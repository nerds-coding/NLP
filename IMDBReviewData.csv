Avatar tells a familiar story but its a story that works so well inside of this movie. The visuals and 3d are still one of the best to date and i totally get why it made so much money.
"I had the rather intense privilege to view James Cameron's much anticipated $400 million budget return to the directing scene, Avatar, at the Empire Leicester Square in London.Where to begin! The visuals in this pieces was groundbreaking. He did it with the Terminator series and then Titanic, so one would expect Cameron to deliver... and HE DID! The visual are by far some of the sharpest CGI I have seen. You could almost say that there is a disquiet that follows Cameron's soul, as there is no other possibility of this strong and intensified quality. Its production design and visual effects are both noteworthy and it will get its praise upon official release.What it was lacking that really should have shaped the movie is its character/story. I was expecting a complex and believable plot, but was left with a movie with mostly strong visuals. What most sci-fi lovers desire is mind-bending philosophies, fantasy and exploration and limitations of our or outer species. If it was not for this factor, I would give this a 9.5 vote.Avatar will be a success, not only because of Cameron's legacy, but by very intelligent and viral marketing. Avatar have had a powerful marketing technique that assembles other successful blockbusters, such as The Blair Witch project (you all remember it), The Dark Knight (Joker invades the world) and also, the current production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) that is intelligently targeting the market.Kudos to Cameron, Avatar is one of the (if not The) movie of the year. I could get in trouble for sharing this with you guys so early, so please click Yes on ""Was the above comment useful to you?"" as a thank you. ;)"
"Well, I just saw Avatar this morning, one of the press premieres which are running on these days. My opinion: you've seen this story a hundred times, but never like this. Finally 3D is what it's supposed to be, an instrument at the service of the movie. You'll enjoy the visual experience, no doubt.As for the story, some of the ""inspirations"" are so huge and so obvious that mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for you, and I'm not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if you like that stuff. If you're 15 or so, you'll have a great time thinking that it's the first time somebody makes something like this. If you're an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at the door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual action-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clichés.I liked it, however: ""the movie that re-invents movies""??? No way."
"Let me preface this by saying I am a huge James Cameron fan. I think ""Terminator"" is a masterpiece of sci-fi and the single best edited film of all time, ""Aliens"" is easily the best sequel not from the original director and I personally like it a lot more than the original. ""Abyss"" created an interesting world and was racked with tension, ""Terminator 2"" is an action tour-de-force and has what I believe the best sound editing/design of all time, ""True Lies"" is goofy fun, more poignant than most give it credit for with a boffo ending, and finally ""Titanic"" was far better than anyone expected it to be and has one of the most believable romances in a movie.So then there was the 12 year wait for ""Avatar"". No reviews, word of mouth, ticket price or natural disaster would keep me from the midnight IMAX 3D screening. I went with moderate expectations, which the film matched exactly. While this kept me from being disappointed it wasn't a good thing.Movie fans were on edge because if ""Avatar"" flops, it'll mean the death of creativity in a remake-happy Hollywood. That's a valid concern but the problem is nothing in ""Avatar"" is creative whatsoever. It is literally ""Dances with Wolves"" in space, right down to having a ""Wind in his Hair"" character as a foil to the ""new guy"".As the movie progressed it caused the worst of all bad reactions for me as a viewer - I started thinking about other things. Then I kept thinking ""well the end battle is supposed to be awesome"".SPOILER WARNING! (if for some reason you can't guess how this movie ends) End battle comes and the movie switches from being ""Dances with Wolves"" to Disney's ""Atlantis"" (but that's unfair since both of those movies contained far, FAR better musical scores) Gunship windows that were impervious to arrows a few scenes ago (to show Na'vi desperation) suddenly become brittle and break easily (to show Na'vi heroism). The battle isn't nearly as long as you'd expect, and nowhere near as epic / engaging as the finale of Return of the King. Finally there's a Robo-suit vs Navi fight and it is admittedly pretty good. Unlike 95% of directors these days Cameron knows enough to pull the camera back and let us SEE the fight. However it's an odd choice to spend millions on 10 foot tall ""creatures"" and then rarely even have them in the same frame as humans.And of course there's the obligatory scene where characters are dying in slow motion as Middle Eastern vocal music plays (see Gladiator or Munich) Wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't said to my friend on the way there ""How much you wanna bet there's a part where characters die in slow motion over Middle Eastern music?""As with most movies these days ""Avatar"" is far too long, glossing over important details (why is Earth dying, what does Unobtainium do, etc) and instead spending time on flight scenes, mystic ceremonies, spirit trees and nature bonding.Ultimately I just did not care. Since the dawn of cinema Hollywood recycles old ideas every few decades and slaps on a bigger budget / new stars / better effects so you won't notice. I can see re-doing ""Ben Hur"" with color and sound, but why do we need ""Dances with Wolves"" with 20 times the budget and blue Native Americans? No amount of impressive visuals, robo-suits, gunship battles, perfect character CGI or Sigorney Weaver can change the fact that I've seen this movie 100 times before. I could even accept the weak story if there were any characters to give a rat's ass about. This film is also dreadfully humorless, a stark contrast to ""Titanic"" where humor was one of its many surprises.Regarding 3D... I've seen many films in it now and honestly you don't even notice after the few minutes. It doesn't make the money any better or worse, just more expensive.Citizen Kane, The Robe, Sound of Music, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Toy Story, The Matrix... these movies changed movies. We can say that looking back now. ""Avatar"" saying it would ahead of time is pure hubris, ""unsinkable Titanic""-like poppycock.But if expensive motion-capture being used to cover up a weak, generic story is the future of cinema then count me out, I'll stick with my PS3."
"First of all, let me get it out of the way: yes, Avatar is visually stunning. With better scenario and dialogs, it could have been a very good movie; alas, it was completely predictable, and fancy special effects alone do not make a good movie.Let's start with the picture. As I said before, the special effects and computer animation are really good; the textures feel very real, and the degrees of liberty that CGI animation allows in terms of camera angles and movement is well used for dramatic effects. The luxurious vegetation of the forest and the CGI-animated wild animals are a treat to the eyes. In terms of artwork, there is a definite influence from Nausicaa (the forest-world, the spores) and Starcraft (the vessels, the goliaths). I saw the movie in an IMAX movie with 3D glasses, but I am not convinced that they used the full potential of it - quite honestly, the Haribo commercial before the movie made a better use of it. I find it more strenuous to watch a movie with the 3D-glasses - some details are blurry, and it feels likewise when the camera makes swift lateral movements.Now, the scenario - the movie disappoints in that area. The plot is very Manichean, and it feels like a remake of Pocahontas, interspersed with elements from / tributes to Star Wars (Pandora and the Na'vi look like Endor and the Ewoks respectively), Nausicaa (the forest as an entity, the destructive impact of civilization on nature, the spores in the forest), Starcraft (Colonel Quarritch and Dr Augustine bear some resemblance with Arcturus Mensk and Sarah Kerrigan), Matrix (the concept of controlling another image of self), and maybe even Independence Day (the pilot fighter suicide) and the Lion King (the father's death, ""go, and never come back!"", ... am I going to far here?). But I can honestly say that I haven't been surprised at any point in the movie. You know from the beginning that he will be accepted by the Na'vi, that he will fall in love, that he will defect, that he will ultimately prevail after suffering some heavy casualties, and that he will find a way to permanently transfer his mind into the body of his avatar.It would have been interesting if the movie had dealt in more depth with the issues related to transferring one's mind into another body for instance, maybe a la Twelve Monkeys Army, where the ""hero"" is clearly deeply affected by experiences that the mind is not used to deal with (time travel in that case, but it is not that different from what we have here). Likewise, the love interest of our hero seems very indifferent to the fact that he really is a human remotely controlling a human - Na'vi bastard. I was expecting someone (him, her, or even one of the other humans in the scientific group) to show at least some kind of surprise / doubt when these feelings emerge. I was expecting more complexity in the social interactions of the characters, and their personality.I also take issues with some big stereotypes: corporations and the white men are greedy, indigenous people are pure, brave, and connected to the earth, but dumb - thankfully there is a human to teach them how to fight those who come from the sky. To some extent, the movie feels like a remake of the colonization of the Americas; just replace the Na'vis by native Americans, the aircrafts by ships, and modern weapons by muskets, and you have it. Except of course the colonization of the Americas did not have such a happy ending for the native tribes.On the whole, the movie is beautiful, but it feels like the main goal was to showcase fancy special effects. The movie would have benefited from more detailed characters, and a less linear and predictable plot. My rating is 6/10."
"I was lucky to see Avatar at a pre-screening a few hours ago. It completely blew me and the whole room away and i dare to say it will do so to 80% of any audience anywhere. The remaining 20%, who always finds something to complain about, will whine about character development, dialog, story or the pop-corn.Well, let me tell you: they went to this movie with the wrong expectations.You have most likely met Cameron's previous work(s): Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic (!), just to name a few.So WHAT should you expect from Avatar??? MORE of the same!!! More of revolutionary film-making, more of grandiose new ideas, more of never-before-seen special effects, more of 150 minutes without relapsing, more of the James Cameron genius...I am very happy that the trailers didn't give the full story away. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also. Cameron was very smart keeping the teasers as teasers, nothing more... as the full movie will take your breath away.You will practically not notice that you are watching a non-existing world, it is sooo real. Attention to detail is superb. You computer geeks will know what I am talking about. This move was not rushed in the making. No wonder it could not have been done before - not having the proper computing power.The wild life, the jungle, the animals, the Na'vi-s, or the dragon-like flying creatures are all so life-like, they almost pop-off the screen (and in 3D they actually do :) .The sound effects were so well done, that when I saw at the credits that Skywalker Sound was behind it, i could only think of ""yessss... now THAT makes sense.""Cameron is a visionaire - and again, he delivers, with full blast.A certain character says in the movie that Pandora (the planet where the story takes place) became his real world. My advice to you: let Pandora become YOUR real world for two and a half hours, let it make you completely forget about your life and problems, let it entertain you, move you, let it carry you away.Because THAT is what i expect as an exchange for my ticket.And a few hours ago i got tens of tickets worth of that."
"Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na'vi. The Na'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.What is most important is the fact that Cameron's story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back."
"I have never been so close to leave the movie theater, as i was when seeing Avatar. Sure, it's very beautiful to look at, but, if you've seen the trailer, then you've seen the movie! It's basically every movie clichés put together in one horrible and so unoriginal movie. it's a mix of the ""last samurai"" meets ""Pocahontas"" meets ""Atlantis""! it's by far the most horrible storyline since Ed Woods' ""plan 9 from outer space"".Not once are you surprised by the turn of events in this movie, and there's so many bad movie clichés in it, and so many things that just doesn't make any sense at all (even in their universe). for example, the last fight scene with the giant robot and the Avatar. It really doesn't make any sense at all, that the robot is carrying a 8-foot-1 hunting knife, just in case he loses his gun (which could easily have been attach to the robot!), and that the robot tells the avatar, what he's about to do, instead of just doing it (A good example of a bad cliché).If you want to see this movie, i recommend you either see the trailer ( as that is enough for you, to litterily, call every scene in the movie) or you go out and buy Atlantis and just Imagine it with smurfs instead of underwater people."
"It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991's Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn't count). So the anticipation for Avatar has long since reached fever pitch and beyond.Thankfully for the patient masses, Avatar has turned out to be the biggest and best event movie of the year, perhaps the decade. The story is pure Cameron simplicity – a paraplegic ex-marine is given a chance to walk again through the use of a unique alien body, called an Avatar. It is his job to gain the trust of the natives so that a greedy corporation can steal the precious metal from their lush moon. Jake's (Sam Worthington) crippled main character is the perfect point of contact for the audience – not only is he new to the visual delights of Pandora but his disability means that every moment in his Avatar body is one of glorious freedom from the confinement of his chair. When the Corporations intentions become more sinister, Jake must choose between his new found place with the natives and his own race and fight for what he believes in.Avatar combines parts of Pocahontas and Braveheart with a liberal dose of Space Marines into an epic whole that takes nearly three full hours to unfold. We could criticise that length, the weak story and the hammy dialogue. We could attack its thinly-veiled ecological message or the frankly bizarre spirituality in its second half but honestly nothing can spoil the experience while you are enveloped in it. And a large part of that is down to the brilliant use of 3D – which is both subtle and incredibly effective. Til now, we have been making movies with 3D elements, Avatar is the first truly 3D film and might well prove to be one of the most significant things to happen to blockbuster film-making since Star Wars.Cameron is also pushing the envelope with truly photo-real CG – something which has been promised for years but has finally been delivered with Avatar. The interactions of the characters with the environment is incredible and the detail on the faces of the motion-captured leads (Worthington and Star Trek's Zoe Saldana) bring them to life. You will believe totally in their performances, representing another quantum leap in tools which have rarely been used for anything other than spectacle.Make no mistake, Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years. Then the final act explodes into tragedy and desperate action, with the final half hour a blistering life or death struggle that has to be seen to be disbelieved.Over the coming days you will be hearing a lot about Avatar, and some of the critical reaction is bound to focus on its weaknesses in a bid to appear appropriately reserved and objective. But this is not a film to be dissected or examined, rather one to be experienced with a warm crowd, a great sound system, in 3D as you bask in the knowledge that the movie-making master is back!"
"I realize I am probably going to get flames galore for this comment, and you all have the right to your opinion about my opinion, but hey, I'm entitled to my opinion too. Avatar is grade A crap. That's right, it's crap. I say this for one simple reason: Without the special effects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of audiences like it has in the past week. Ask yourself this one question: If it didn't have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the trees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in Matrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about this movie at all? It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than Dances with Wolves in space. Some people may argue back that Star Wars borrowed from Hidden fortress, but at least it had enough compelling plot points to make it look different, such as I don't know... the force? The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has NOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly differentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference between Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty but it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking of, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes. The worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters. You know what? I'll go one step further and say that the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is this: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That's it. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done. Still, there's that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge let-down and doesn't belong on the best-of list of anybody with common sense."
"At the risk of repeating what countless others have said, this movie is blatant plagiarism. If a film student submitted the Avatar screenplay to an instructor, he/she would have been given an F. Colleges expel students for less obvious ripoffs than this. If you've watched Pocahontas or Dances With Wolves, you know the drill. The only difference is the ending, which has the pretty blue humanoids escorting humans to their Earth-bound ships at gunpoint, which I freely admit is a rather neat sight since my ancestors were American Indian, Irish, and Scot. As a result, I am perhaps overly sensitive to the plight of a civilization driven from their homeland and/or oppressed by a conquering nation - er, planet.However, originality is not James Cameron's strong suit, so my disappointment is directed more at WETA. Yes, my beloved WETA, who impressed me throughout the years but completely stole my heart after the masterful rendering of all things Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I had two reasons for seeing this film. One was a 13-year-old boy, the other was my anticipation over what wonders WETA would lay at my feet.Now, had the budget not been nearly half a billion dollars, I'd have understood the cartoonish creations, but as it stands there's no good reason for the results. Viewers are praising this film as revolutionary. I call ""horsesh!t"". This was nowhere near the caliber of WETA's LOTR work, their King Kong work, or their X-Men work. In fact, it wasn't even up to snuff with their Narnia production. The quantity of work was greater, not the quality.I've never reviewed a film in my life. I actually registered here for the sole purpose of expressing my resentment at having wasted $20 bucks and 3 hours on such nonsense. Booooooo."
"I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, but I am giving it a 1, because I cannot believe that it deserves an 8.8, which is what it is getting this evening, mostly apparently due to suspicious ratings from countries like Slovakia, India and Australia. Not that I have anything against those countries, it just strikes me as odd that so few good reviews are coming from the United States. I'm not saying that IMDb's ratings are being manipulated by some sort of conspiracy, I am just saying it is odd. Anyways, rather than try and balance my review with what was good (the visuals, the 3D, the sound effects), am just going to say what really sucked. Can I say ""sucked"" in my review? Guess I will find out.1. ""Unobtainium."" Really, ""unobtainium?"" Was this a kid's cartoon? 2. Sigourney Weaver's confused and cartoonish scientist character. She's tough, she smokes, she has a heart of gold, and her Avatar dresses like Dora the Explorer. Also, why try and make her look twenty years younger than she is? I can't tell if they used CGI, Botox, or a ton of make-up, but she looked like the female version of the Picture of Dorian Gray. What a waste of talent.3. Hundres of years in the future, they can create magical avatar clones and transmit brain signals to them, but they still use flimsy wheelchair thingies? 4. Less than a half dozen animals on Pandora, and all but the floating jellyfish are angry and violent. Really? No fish? No birdies? No toads, snails, foxes, puppy dogs, kitty cats, mosquitoes, or anything but those half dozen CGI creature types? Seems like Pandora was populated by a relatively cheap CGI outfit.5. The trees all communicate through synapses, and this is supposed to be ominous, yet this never turns into anything compelling. Did Jimmy Cameron get tired of his own idea? Or was it to hrd to animate something more interesting? 6. Almost half a billion dollars to make this?!?!?!?!? 7. ""Unobtainium?"" ""Unobtainium?????"" 8. Cartoony tough military guy who does not have a clue how to organize a military campaign.9. The Na'Vi speak broken English that somehow becomes perfect English on and off throughout the movie. And the Avatars speak perfect English in normal tone of voice, identical to their human voices, although their bone structure is completely non-human?!?!?!? 10. Unobtainium I could go on and on, but you get the picture. This was like an extremely expensive and pretty kiddie cartoon. What a waste, and absolutely NOT deserving of the rating it is getting here."
"First I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for cinema anymore. And somehow people are showing me that I was right. I went to watch this piece of .... because I have been told it s unbelievable.Storywise, there is no story at all. It's the typical good vs bad scenario shaped out of cowboys against indians in space mixing it with a yogi everything connects us to the world impression plus a goddamn planet called Pandora and looks like f...in' paradise. Lot's of shiny colours and huge monsters who eat flesh are your best friends. Come on. You gotta be kidding me.Maybe I might be the only one here, cause all reviews I've seen got great score, but that is not what a movie is supposed to be. I was very unimpressed by the CGI and the artistic development because I might be used to computer games such as Final Fantasy series which has been the shaper of such incredible stories, only that these games have a very strong story to tell and and you feel totally involved.It impresses me that people give this such a high rating because of it's visuals. I mean it was clear that sooner or later a movie would appear with such incredible CGI. If it wouldn't have been Avatar another would have been the winner.I am sad that nowadays cinema is ail centered only about violence, good looks and a huge lack of brain.3 out of ten only for the cgi which I thought is not the center of a movie otherwise I would have rated it beneath 0."
"""Ok, I get it."" That's a phrase I found myself saying an awful lot during this 2 1/2 hour computer game that was as painful to the brain as it was to the eyes.First, let's get the obvious out of the way. This film was expensive, in that it cost so much money to make you could solve at least one state's budget crisis with it. So why did it look like it was nearly all conceived on a computer? Not since the ""Star Wars"" prequels has the ""fourth wall"" ever been so demolished. Never once did I care about the characters or believe anything the actors tried to do because I knew it was completely artificial. Hell, people still complain about ""Waterworld"" being overpriced but at least people actually got off their duffs and did some real film shooting! This whole project stinks of imported bottled water and soy lattes. This film is the pinnacle of Hollywood overkill. An overblown, overpriced, overindulgent eyesore of a movie with a ""message."" Oh yes, the message. Underneath watching the latest in nerd fantasy-fulfillment with its CGI, is a liberal-minded jackhammer drilling into your psyche about the evil of American corporatism, military culture, and rich white men's greed. The noble intent of getting its audience to care about the environment is done in the LSD-esquire rainbow cornucopia of every Native American and African stereotype imaginable, all set to an ""oweyo oweyo"" New Age chorus that makes one actually pine for the sweet sound of the Jonas Brothers. I say this as a die-hard independent who has as much to say about environmental awareness as anyone with a college education, but the caricatures painted here border on MSNBC-levels of leftist philosophy. The bad guys are the Republican racist military and corporate oppressors, who refer to our heroes as ""tree huggers"" and the alien Navi as ""savages,"" and see their violence against them as ""fighting terror with terror."" I'm not kidding, they actually use soundbites from the last decade as part of the script. One character actually refers to the military attacks as ""shock and awe."" If you don't want to heave from the vertigo-inducing sweep of the completely sterile computer-created world of Pandora, the dialog will surely get you to bending over the toilet cursing the day you ever thought this was worth even half its price tag.See, there was a movie made very recently that dealt with valid socio-political issues that was full of interesting characters and top-notch CGI at a fraction of ""Avatar's"" cost. It was called ""District 9"" and if you haven't seen it, do so and then come tell me what you thought of ""Avatar."" Because the former film was able to show the evils of racism without painting its characters as one-dimensional caricatures. It showed that greed knew no color boundaries, and that you can combine action with a message and not be beaten over the head with it.I would advise people to avoid this film, however I know that is next to impossible. This has become the new ""Titanic,"" where seeing it is not only an option, but a requirement with some groups of people. I like to refer to those people as ""STUPID."""
"I simply cannot believe how over-zealous the users of this site are. Actually i can. It was exactly the same for There Will be Blood and every other hyped film there has been recently. Some of the adjectives used to describe Avatar beggar belief: 'The Best Movie of All Time' 'A Masterpiece' 'Mesmorising, Spellbinding, Extraordinary!'. I really do wish i could agree. I was looking forward to this as much as most and i'm a huge fan of Cameron's previous work. Avatar, however, is a massive disappointment, and i'm convinced once the hype surrounding the technology and CGI dies down people will realise that. It really is a reflection of the times that people can be so suckered in by fancy visuals and things blowing up. Please, for a moment, look at the merits of this film, CGI aside, and you'll see that they are pretty much on par with a hundred previous sci-fi b-movies/TV-series. The story is completely derivative, the action unrealistic, the dialogue.....oh God, don't get me started. James Cameron has obviously been spending far too much time with George Lucas. The dialogue is atrocious and painfully clichéd. There is no convincing character development at all. I can barely remember any of their names let alone have any sort of affinity with them. Sam Worthington is a waste of space. I don't know what this Hollywood fixation is with him, but he was terrible in Terminator Salvation and he is terrible in this. The cartoon, morally-vacant human 'baddies' are an insult to intelligence and unbelievable at every turn. The entire plot is 100% predictable. Of course we knew the humans weren't go to win. Of course not. Not with their space-travelling, cryo-genetic-using, high-tech weaponary-toting mentality. They didn't understand the forest, man. Please. This is almost as laughable as Return of the Jedi. And the lame efforts to instill some sort of sentimentality and moral message through the use of poorly-written pseudo-spiritual crap just made me cringe. I wasn't even that impressed with the character design. Cameron has basically taken Native American Indians and Antipodean Aborigines and turned them blue. They have similar attire, ride 'horses', shoot arrows etc etc. It was just all too familiar.Avatar may well be a technological breakthrough, and i look forward to others who take the technology on and remember to actually pair it with an original and compelling story, but for now though, this film is a bulging case of style over substance if ever there has been one.I miss Aliens. Now that was a convincing movie.4/10"
"I heard that this film was going to be the benchmark in modern film making. I heard this film was to be the largest grossing film of all time, and perhaps even the most captivating. As a film lover I could not miss it, and to make sure I didn't miss out on everything James Cameron had to offer me, I saw it in the largest iMax cinema in England, in 3d. Keep in mind, I am now writing this review a week or so after seeing it so as to let my initial reactions subside and compose and sensible, rational and correct report on what I experienced, and yet my first words are still WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!Let me try and address this in an ordered fashion.Plot: Terrible, shameful and embarrassing. Not only to mention that it was almost an exact copy of Pocahontas (literally), it just wasn't at all interesting. You knew from the outset exactly how the film was going to end, it was cliché, boring and hamfisted from beginning to end. Anyone who can honestly say that the plot was captivating must be drunk, an idiot, or joking. Also, I know people go on about this, but seriously, UNOBTANIUM??? I understand trying to make a commentary on our endeavours as mankind, but calling the object unobtanium reduces the intellectual level to Sesame Street. Also, the fact that the Na'vi who could speak English went from relatively stunted English to perfect English and back again through out the film bothered me more than a little. And when the natives win that one battle, the humans, who desperately want this 'unobtanium' as it will make them all mindboggingly rich, and can afford to pay for whole armies to try and get it, give up? They just aren't going to come back? That's ridiculous, they'd nuke the place.Characters / Characterisation: Uni-dimensional to the end. No depth whatsoever. Prime example of this is the military captain who is, in all senses, a cartoon stereotype military captain, there was no reason or rhyme behind his actions apart from the fact that he is a military captain. The self-interested capitalist, who in the end was nothing more than a self-interested capitalist? No! Surely not! And the hero, who, from beginning to end, portrays no real traits that give him away to be anything other than a complete hero. Wow. I'm so impressed.Acting: No one captivated me. No one stood out. Even Sigourney Weaver, an actress who I usually hold in quite high esteem, was pretty poor. I blame Cameron.Special Effects: Yes. They were impressive. This is where my 1 star comes from. But, forgive me for being a bit of a traditionalist, but I think in any film no more than 1 star should ever be entirely devoted to special effects. That being said, they were impressive, they weren't biblical. It's not like I walked out of the cinema unable to speak from awe. Furthermore, aside from the technical quality of the special effects, the world itself was not that inventive, intelligently designed or beautiful. They were essentially in a jungle with a few animals that just looked like mutated versions of Earth animals. And some odd jellyfish type things. If you want truly beautiful films watch something like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"", I'd say both of these have more impressive scenery than Avatar does. Directing:Uninventive. Nothing really new there. Impressive shots of scenery perhaps, but pretty much normal camera-work throughout. A very cheesy montage to show the hero and his woman getting closer and closer. A standard battle scene. No James Cameron, not impressive.The bottom line is this, I know and you know that if it wasn't for its 3D effects, and the fact that it had James Cameron's name attached to it, Avatar would probably have been straight to DVD. Some people have said that people don't like it because they don't understand Sci Fi. That's ridiculous. I love Sci Fi, it's my favourite genre. But compared with classics like Alien, or 2001, this was an affront. So shame on you James Cameron, for insulting our intelligence by thinking that nothing more than pretty lights are needed to make a good film. Though, in the end, I guess you were right, as most people seem to be inexplicably raving about it. Maybe all people want in a film are just pretty lights, and that's pretty sad to see.Poor, poor show."
"It gets praised to no end for its great story, depth of characters and unselfish care for all the holds life, even though if you actually put that aside, you have more than enough to go on with CGI, FX and the very much needed ""nature good trashy  bad"" story. Special effects are supposed to be an extra thing to enjoy in a film, and Avatar delivers in all other areas as well."
"Literally thousands of people have already written reviews about AVATAR - some qualified, some not so qualified - so why would I feel the urge to post my first ever movie review about it? Maybe because it has been the first movie for more than a decade that made me wish to see (or rather: EXPERIENCE) it right again the moment the credits started rolling and the lights went on. Definitely because the overwhelming majority of critical reviews to me seem to be exactly what they accuse AVATAR to be: schematic, one-dimensional, simplified, predictable and with lots of well known content.I agree with those characterizing the story to be simple, predictable and quite an eclectic blend of well known stories, BUT that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not working or even being a bad one. On the contrary, it's simplicity helps the general audience to not get lost along the way and focus on the really new and unique aspects, namely the exposure to a completely unfamiliar environmental and cultural setting. The level of detail Cameron has put into creating this earth-like planet (moon, technically) together with all the flora and fauna hasn't been seen since Tolkien's Middlearth. What makes it even more compelling is that almost every aspect really has a solid and believable scientific foundation. Although fitted with a simple structure, the story never tends to be dumb like in so many other blockbusters, especially those dealing with science-fiction. On the contrary, Cameron manages to pick up quite a lot of current social, political and environmental issues (e.g. ignorance against foreign cultures/civilizations, privatization of warfare, corporate profits before morale and the well being of others) and still makes it entertaining instead of boring.With AVATAR Cameron has proved again that he can not only deliver in terms of action but especially when it comes to telling a simple story in such a way that it's almost impossible to not feel emotionally touched and involved. I've seen this movie several times by now and each time I could feel the same emotional grip all over the audiences, quite a lot leaving the theater with tears in their eyes. Unlike Bay or Emmerich, Cameron has mastered to reach out to a broad audience far beyond the young and predominantly male focus group for action movies and get it to bond with the characters instead of just watching an effects-laden movie.In terms of visual effects AVATAR absolutely is the game changer Cameron had promised it to be. While there have been other movies using 3D lately not one of them succeeded like this one in not using 3D as a mere gimmick but instead as an essential part of the cinematic experience. After a few minutes of adjusting you get completely submerged into the movie and it makes you feel like you are really taking part in an event unfolding around you instead of just watching a pre-recorded performance.Although the use of 3D helped considerably in making this movie a submersing experience it's only second place in terms of technical achievement when you consider the leap forward in creating believable human(oid) CGI characters this movie represents. After being left with more or less creepy feelings watching ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" where the CGI characters had more resemblance to zombies than to living human beings, I was quite skeptical about Cameron's ability to live up to his promises and was blown away when I finally did watch the movie. Especially the close ups in many emotionally touching scenes, where even the tiniest recognizable artificiality of the CGI characters would have ruined everything (e.g. on dying Eytucan after the destruction of the Hometree, Neytiri hiding behind a tree and watching the soldiers closing in on her or Neytiri breaking up in tears after she barely managed to save Jake from suffocation) did deliver on such a great level that I am still in awe. I have watched the close up of Naytiri hiding behind a tree and watching the soldiers closing in on her from the official Trailer in Full HD over and over again and still I can't see any hint on her being a CGI character.A third an not to be underestimated technical innovation that helped a lot in delivering a convincing CGI environment is the virtual camera that was used to capture the performances as if shot with a real camera in the currently so famous hand-held style which added another layer of realism, especially to the action sequences (e.g. Jake getting chased by the Thanator or flying next to Neytiri when she takes her Ikran for a ride around the Hometree).Regarding James Horner's score I do have mixed feelings. It ranges from well done to excellent for most parts of the movie and considerably adds to the emotional impact in many scenes (e.g. the arrival in space at that mystical moon Pandora, the devastation of the Na'vi after the destruction of the Hometree or the fighting montage in slow motion when Tsu'tey and other characters get struck down). However, there are a few instances, especially the mass scenes at the tree of souls, where the music completely fails and even took me out of the whole movie experience back into the real world for a moment because it did annoy me that much. When the Na'vi are gathered around the tree of souls praying it sounds more like a spiritual hippie happening than desperate and displaced indigenous people praying for help. Likewise the music used for both ""transfer"" scenes when the Na'vi are trying to transfer the human souls of Grace and Jake into their avatar bodies didn't help at all and made the scenes rather feel kitschy."
"I'm speechless... utterly speechless! This movie has earned how much worldwide - over 1 billion dollars? Why? They say there are only 5 scripts in Hollywood and this surely confirms it. Throughout the entire time I'm thinking Pocahontas and believe it or not - Fern Gully. The visuals are pretty to look at with the forest being the leader. The forest during the day that is... because at night the forest turns into a Disney style show of corny ultraviolet foliage and grass that glows when you step on it (a la the video of Michael Jackson singing Billie Jean). Each animal is obviously based on an earth animal, only they have more legs or extra eyes – apparently this is what passes for imagination these days. And the floating mountains - Miyazaki pulled it off years ago in Laputa:Castle in the Sky, in this film they're just plain out of place. The love story is predictably obvious and boring. And hold off on the popcorn as large portions of dialogue about the back-story are forced down your throat in the most unintelligent and obvious way. As for the culture of the tribe... well it seems to be a mix of almost every stereotypical African and South American tribe, ever... rolled into one big ball of naf unbelievable tripe. In short this movie was really a waste of my time and money. And too paraphrase a review I once heard in relation to another disappointing film in recent years - With a budget $240 million this film really needs to be either a cure for cancer, or bloody entertaining; sadly it fails on both fronts. James Cameron – disappearing for another 12 years would be a true godsend!"
"With a budget like this you would think that, at the very least, basic elements of a decent film should not be lacking. Well written story, passable dialog, above par actors, etc...Well, welcome to Hollywood!!! Those things have been relegated to the past! No more worrying about where that clever plot twist will lead, or that enigmatic character, or those subtle hints and tics in the dialog that aren't in-your-face obvious. Avatar blazes a new trail to where Money and Technology apparently rut for days, then pop out a bouncing baby masterpiece!!! Rad! Where to begin? Stream of consciousness/associative thinking might get it over with quickest. Fern Gully in Space (minus Tim Curry's voice), Dances with Wolves only worse, and Smurfs without believable characters like Gargamel and his cat come immediately to the fore. Pastel overdose.UNOBTAINIUM!!!"
"Visuals: For years Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and all sorts of other sci-fi or fantasy movies have been trying to take us to another world. This one succeeded, and it was so beautiful. I swear that I had a religious experience in reaction to the visuals to this movie, probably akin to the feeling that many people had when they watched the original Star Wars for the first time in theaters. I don't tend to get teary eyed over physical beauty that often, but this world moved me to tears from the sheer beauty of it. It was like stepping inside an expressionistic painting. If you get a chance to see this in 3D, do it! If you get a chance to see it in the theater, do it! If you miss out on all that and watch your DVD in an old tube television, well... still watch it, although you might not have quite the same reaction as everyone else. The visuals get an A, and I somehow feel that an A isn't high enough to do this movie justice.Sound: If the sound had failed, then the visuals would have too. Pandora sounded alive and organic. The creatures made sounds that matched the visuals and the music superbly added to the drama of what was going on. A Acting: I tip my hat to every actor in this movie. The humans interacted with the CG characters in such an organic way that I really never questioned the fact that the humans were reacting to no one. Sam Worthington, mixing this with his roles in Terminator 4 and Clash of the Titans, may be establishing himself to be the next big action star since Jason Statham. Likewise, Zoe Saldana's career is on the rise as she just came off playing Uhura in the Star Trek reboot. And then there's Stephen Lang... good Lord, I do not want him angry with me under any circumstances ever. The man was ripped in this movie and looked like he could give Chuck Norris a run for his money. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing a movie with Stephen Lang portraying a character very similar to his role as Col. Miles Quaritch, but as the movie's main protagonist instead of villain. The acting department gets an A! Story: Normally, I tackle story first thing in my reviews. I saved it for last here, because I really loved this movie, but that doesn't mean that I'm blind to some issues with the storyline.My initial review was too long for IMDb, to read my full review visit tacmovies.blogspot.comAnyhow, this is the archetypal mole goes native story. There are some shocking similarities between it and the novel Call Me Joe, and it wouldn't be the first time that Cameron had been sued for plagiarism, as Harlan Ellison sued him over Terminator, but I still think that simultaneous creation is possible in this instance. Regardless, the story is pretty good, but it's definitely the weakest link in the chain. All of the characters played their parts in making this story function, but I definitely thought some parts were written a bit shallow, for instance (SPOILER WARNING): 1. The Na'vi never once thought that Jake was giving intel to the humans? I think tvtropes.com might call this ""Plot Induced Stupidity,"" especially when you consider that they only let him stay there to gain intel on the humans. Slightly hypocritical, if you ask me. Since we're on the subject, Neytin turned on Jake and immediately never wanted to see him again before the humans attacked and her father died. This despite the fact that the Na'vi mate for life and the two just mated. After taming a red dragon-like creature, she welcomes him back with open arms.Okay, this functionally works to progress the story, but I think a better progression would have been to have the two mate, Jake reveals his mole status and the rest of the Na'vi turn on Jake but Neytin, feeling that strong, irrational mating bond, stands by her man until her father dies, at which point she turns on him. Jake then tames a red dragon and symbolically regains the trust of the Na'vi but it takes a little longer for Neytin to forgive him. At least, that's how I would have done it.2. The evil human corporation is willing to massacre innocent natives to make a quick buck. It's so one dimensional that it's painful. Not to say that it couldn't happen, but I wanted more, and I think the movie hinted at more. In fact, Worthington's character mentioned that the earth had been ruined somehow. If we as a race no longer had a home world and were dependent upon Unobtainium to survive, and the Na'vi were unwilling to negotiate giving us any Unobtainium for over six years (which the movie stated was the timetable the negotiations had gone), then I think stealing it wouldn't necessarily have been the right thing to do morally, but necessary for the survival of the human race. The story hints that this is what's going on behind the scenes, but never says it outright probably because we the audience would turn on Jake Sully if we knew that. In any case, I would have preferred that the storyline be less cut and dry. The soldiers just started shooting. They didn't try a covert mission to steal the Unobtainium first, and the money grubbing corporation didn't recognize the potential money to be made in harvesting the forest's telepathy/soul bank? Again, I thought the writing was okay, but with some major problems. C Overall: You should see this movie. It's awesome. Yes, the writing is a bit shallow at times, but it's still really good in spite of the writing. A"
"I can't honestly say I am a huge James Cameron fan (Lucas and Spielberg hold that honor) but his movies never cease to give you more of what you want out of movies, an escape from the every day. Avatar does just that, takes you on one wild far out ride. The graphics are amazing; I was seriously sitting there trying to figure out what was real and what was not. It's hard, because it all fits together so seamlessly that you actually believe that Pandora exists and that you could really go there. Even the aliens looked real; the Sigourney Weaver Avatar LOOKED JUST LIKE Sigourney Weaver. Like she was wearing makeup or something like that. And let's be honest, who hasn't wanted to see Sigourney Weaver as an 8 foot tall blue alien? But this also made me think that if we have this type of technology now just think of what we could do!? Chris Farley in a movie with Humphrey Bogart? Who knows? The possibilities are limitless! Leave it to the creator of the Terminator to come up with this. This movie WILL change the way all future movies are made, of that there is no doubt.But as I watched a few things came to my mind that bothered me and I hope you will indulge me for a moment.....#1-Why is it that every movie that uses the military uses them as bad guys who are hell bent on killing and blowing things up? Once the main Colonel came on screen I said ""There's your 'Bad Guy'"" He fit the typical stereo type of military in movies to a T. Too over the top of you ask me, like a cartoon villain.#2-So the main brother dies and they decide to bring in the twin brother Jake to take his place, with no background information or training for this mission? This guy has no idea what he's doing, so what would the odds be of him getting there and being killed after the first day cause he had no idea what to expect? If the Avatars were so expensive you think they would spend more time to train him so he lives and gets the job done instead of throwing him into it and hoping for the best.#3-So this mineral is important, I get it, and they want it bad I get that too. But with the technology that the humans have why didn't they just dig under the tree? Why bother the locals if they are so hell bent against you? Use the Avatars to mine the mineral behind the locals backs and your problem is solved.#4-Michelle Rodriguez's character.....I get she was the 'Ripley' of the movie. But why is the 'rebel chick who will save the day' always the one in the tight fitting and rather revealing outfit? Also, half the things she wore cannot possibly be regulation military wear, if it is I wanna join.#5-Why did this corporation have the military there anyway? It was not a military operation, and you have big bulldozers that would easily crush the locals, so why bother with the Jarheads? #6-There was no plot. Sorry, but it's true. This was pretty much Dances with Wolves like everyone says. You can see it coming a million miles away. The first 20 minutes into Avatar and I knew where it was going. It was awesome to see and experience, but there was no reason to really be there.#7-Thank god they had that mind transferring tree thing, because Jake alienates himself from the humans to live with the locals. Hate to tell you Jake but you are still a guy in an Avatar body, what kind of life would you have living two lives? Would your human body really be able to take that for a long extended period of time? Did you think that through? #8-Seriously, was all the bombs and blowing up stuff REALLY needed? There had to be another way. That was too much. Committing genocide for some rocks? Dear lord, what will we become? Please tell me this is not because of global warming.There are others but just minor nitpicks from me and I won't bother you with them.Don't get me wrong, Avatar is an experience like no other, but you need to leave the rational part of your mind at the door, this is the type of movie that takes you away to another place but refuses to answer your questions when you're done.And that's all we want now a days anyway, a movie that will take us away from reality for a while."
"This film has nothing worthy of the box office receipts is has garnered. Any third grader can predict the outcome after the first ten minutes. The plot, characters, and themes are either one dimensional or blatant rip offs of earlier tales. Even those parts of the movie that are rehashing some of the great movies of history are delivered without any depth or structure. Consider the poorly constructed moral and it can be seen that it could have been stolen from ""Dances with Wolves"" and others before it, but taken without the bones to support it.Special effects were interesting, but again lacking in any thought to character development. Creatures of this other world were clearly developed in an attempt to make them look ""cool"" without any thought to the evolutionary challenges that may have helped to shape them.It is possible that there is an intended message relating to the tension between science and religion, but it is hardly worth trying to evaluate the directors message. There is so little substance to this movie that the only possible conclusion that one could come to is that the analysis was not worth the effort."
"OK, so I walked in to movie theater excited for what most have claimed to be an awesome movie. I walk out, however, brooding over certain aspects of the movie that made it terrible. For instance, the idea is that of Pocahontas, The last Samurai, and HUNDREDS of other movies and stories already out there. Beyond lacking originality, the screenplay sucked. Character development was even worse in this movie, as EVERY SINGLE character in this movie is flat,not a single one qualifies as a round character. Many parts of the movie were corny, some of the supernatural aspects were really lame and stupid, and overall the movie had the inability to move or effect the viewer. i must admit the CGI was cool, but otherwise, this was a failure."
"I had high expectations going into Avatar. Now I admit, it's probably stupid to go into any movie with expectations that are too high, lest they be crushed. However, even without high expectations, Avatar impresses only on a technical level, and on that level only. The story is very predictable, and as I watched this movie I was overcome with a feeling as if I had seen this all before in something in a made for TV movie on SyFy. This is pretty bad considering this is the same guy who made The Abyss and Terminator. I can only say that if you go see this movie, expect beautiful visuals... and a standard humdrum story that you've seen before if you follow any number of science fiction TV shows or just sci-fi in general. Oh, and if this is the 22nd century, why are they still using manually propelled wheelchairs?"
"Sorry to not be with the masses on this one, but I would classify myself as being a little bit of a film buff in the sense that I've watched so many movies, even if I don't like them and know I won't, I'll still watch it out of interest. And this film actually made me LOL at my own criticisms as it was too easy to criticize. Story = humans want precious metal (or whatever), aliens occupy the area with said mineral, humans (americans actually) infiltrate in order to get, infiltrator betrays humans. uh-huh. Writing = absolutely trash, who wrote this again, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't look for his (camerons) name at the end because I can safely say it'll be the last of his films I'll watch. Honestly people, take a slight step back when watching this and you realize that he is writing for the uneducated adolescents who need stupid sentences to understand, or, hhhmm a three minute running scene to show ""how emotional it must have been for him to reuse his legs"", come on, as soon as he stood up I got it, BUT NO, 3 mins, corny heartwarming music, camera angles of his legs, then his smile, then his feet, then smile, then legs all the time with somebody shouting after him,n ""stop, you're not ready to run yet"". I mean, does this drivel really constitute as a 8.5 out of 10. Actually, I'm getting too annoyed now. Watch this film and imagine that it wasn't full of 1990's intro graphics from good PC games, imagine them as people acting, and hopefully you'll see some sense. I found one good idea in the film, that's the aliens can join up with the other animals/trees blah blah, but other than that, not one other original idea, I mean, even the female aliens, look just like the alien equivalent of human females, come on imaginations, where are you. Sorry James Cameron, I'm sorry that you made Terminator (which I find is great) and you've slowly gone downhill where you sell into the masses (who shoot in all probability, be shot) rather than trying to make a good film."
"James Cameron once more shows that he knows what he is doing. I finally get to watch it yesterday in 3D after waiting so long, and it was worth all the reviews and even better. I am still in shock from what I experienced. The visual effects and the 3D experience in the movie- you have to watch it with your own eyes to feel the magic James Cameron has captured with this masterpiece. Acting is excellent, you can't ask for anything more than the actors gave from science fiction. Whoever said no love or passion in the movie is mistaking big time, it has something for everyone starting from astonishing score (bravo! James Horner) and love story, big epic, awesome war episode and a unrepeatable beauty of Pandora- WOW. If you didn't like the movie at any point, you seriously need to see your doctor. After coming out of the cinema, all I could think about was to go back in, so that's what I am doing today and probably tomorrow as well. Thank you, James Cameron for the best experience of my life!"
"It was hard to believe that two hours and forty minutes had passed by the time this movie ended. This movie takes off right from the get-go, grabs a hold of you and drags you on a spectacular ride that leaves you breathless by the end. You've probably seen a few people say ""it's Dances With Wolves on an alien planet,"" or ""the storyline is too archetypal/predictable,"" but those don't scratch the surface. There's so much going on in this movie, and even the shortest of scenes can carry so much weight if you're paying honest attention to it.One of my biggest concerns going into this movie was that there would be 45 minutes or more of buildup before you really reached paydirt. There wasn't, and I don't know what it was about the trailers that made me think otherwise. You barely get 10-15 minutes of introduction to the characters before Jake is logged into his Avatar and testing it out. Like you could see in the trailer, he's simply thrilled to have working legs under him again, and Cameron did an absolutely phenomenal job of capturing what might have been a minor fact were this anyone else's film. Just the look on Jake's avatar's face when he starts wiggling his toes is brilliant.Nothing about this movie is simple; even when a scene appears to have little importance, the way Cameron has brought them all together makes each only a piece of what turns into a beautiful puzzle. The death and burial of an old Na'vi woman whose name is never revealed lasts all of maybe 8-10 seconds, and yet Sam Worthington's voice-over during the part makes it have such a huge impact. It's like the first time you see the creature in Alien: it's only 6 frames but it sticks with you throughout the movie and beyond. And that's the point here: people are going to talk about the visuals and your first instinct will be to think they mean the CGI, but that's not the case. The visuals are stunning in every way imaginable; each small scene is important, every facet of Na'vi life that is shown carries some weight - particularly to Jake - and the amount of work put into their tails, ears, eyes, and the motion-capture used for their facial expressions was worth every penny.The CGI is beyond phenomenal, and what Cameron has done here is kill any excuse by future movie-makers for having shoddy CGI. It's seamless, and it's hard to tell where live action ends and CGI begins much of the time - in fact, you won't even realize you're going from one to the other even when you go from the Na'vi to the humans and back. Even in those scenes where you have both humans and Na'vi on the screen together or even touching, it's clean and beautiful and only multiplies the effect. I was fortunate to see this movie at the IMAX-3D theatre, and it was worth the extra money: all that talk about birds and insects and whatnot flying through scenes wasn't just talk - it's incredible to behold.This movie may require the more faint of heart to bring a box of tissues with them. This is not the type of movie where someone dies and the main and supporting characters just go all crazy with rage and become ten times more fierce. Again Cameron has captured the grief surrounding the deaths of friends and loved ones with a deep intensity that is, at times, crushing (some of the scenes still bring tears to my eyes twelve hours later, and I don't cry at movies). Referring back to the scene I mentioned earlier with the burial of the Na'vi woman - it's very intense, powerful stuff, especially considering that the scene is seconds long and she's never named; if you're not getting an emotional jolt out of this movie then you're truly missing out on half of its power.On the way out of the theatre there were a few people complaining that it was predictable, even though they really liked it; the ultimate point is that Cameron has told a beautiful story, and despite the times when you go ""Oh, I know what he's going to do now,"" it's very easy to become attached to the characters, and care what happens to them. When people die, it hurts; Cameron has established all of the major characters to a point where you don't look at them and think ""This guy's cannon fodder."" All of them are integral to the story, and even during the epic battle toward the end of the movie, it's hard not to be moved by the casualties of even nameless Na'vi.Cameron is very proud of this movie and he should be; considering his history of Aliens, Terminator, Terminator2, and Titanic, it's hard to just look at something like this and say it's his best - but I truly feel this is. As much as I loved Aliens (formerly my favorite movie of all time), it did not move me the way Avatar did. I doubt any other movie ever will. DO NOT wait to see this on DVD or Blue-Ray; get to the theatre and watch this jewel of cinematography. If you can, see it on the IMAX-3D screen. You won't regret it, and I guarantee that.To parents wondering how children might handle this, the PG-13 rating is mostly due to language and the violence of the epic battle. There's no sex in the movie, though it is mentioned and there is a sort of fade-to-black that's confirmed later on. Last but not least, you do see Na'vi breasts from time to time but it's done tastefully, rarely, and in such a way that it's not throwing it in your face - if you're not looking at the right part of the screen you likely won't even notice."
"My expectations going to see ""Avatar"" were low. I anticipated a special effects-driven, predictable action movie with little or no story. The visual effects are unquestionably impressive. The art design is beautiful, and the artistic concept for the terrain, flora and fauna of Pandora is consistent and appealing. The story is indeed predictable, at least superficially, sort of an extraterrestrial ""Dances With Wolves"" that may also serve as an allegory for the present-day US military and, especially, mercenary presence in the Middle East. But these things alone didn't make ""Avatar"" a box-office smash.Director James Cameron utilizes long-time collaborator Sigourney Weaver to give the cast a credible, old-school science fiction foundation. As ever, Weaver delivers a solid and believable performance as Dr. Grace Augustine, the hardened and pragmatic chain-smoking scientist in charge of the Avatar project. The counterpoint to Weaver's Grace is relative newcomer Sam Worthington's Jake Sully. Worthington is recognizable to science fiction fans as the protagonist of the most recent Terminator movie. Jake Sully is a marine, the antithesis of a scientist.With a damaged spine, Jake is confined to a wheelchair and can not afford corrective surgery. He agreed to come to Pandora with his twin brother, who was to participate in the Avatar project -- have his mind linked by machinery to a Pandora-indigenous humanoid body grown in a test tube and matched to his DNA. Jake's brother is killed before the film begins, and Jake agrees to takes his place (as they have identical DNA). Jake has really given up hope before the film begins. He can no longer be the only thing he has ever known or wanted to be: a marine.Jake has, however, taken a step outside his cynicism and ennui by making the decision to take his brother's place -- he has agreed to enter into the unknown. This is the first step in what is to become the journey that defines him and is the real story in the film.Humans are on Pandora to mine Unobtanium, a mineral concentrated underneath the home of the indigenous people, the Na'vi. The Avatar project was developed to allow humans to establish relationships with the Na'vi, breathing Pandoran air and looking like the Na'vi. It is hoped that the Na'vi will eventually agree to relocate in order to allow mining to begin. The corporate head of the mining project, portrayed effectively by Giovani Ribisi, is reminiscent of Paul Reiser's Carter Burke in Cameron's 1986 ""Aliens"" -- a wimpy minor bureaucrat bent on personal gain. He is assisted by the unscrupulous ex-Marine mercenary Colonel Miles Quaritch, given life by Stephen Lang.Jake becomes involved with Na'vi native Neytiri, wonderfully voiced by Zoe Saldana, whose work in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and ""Star Trek"" (2009) have already made her a familiar and respected actor. Neytiri is charged with teaching Jake the ways of the Na'vi, and Jake inevitably becomes enthralled with both Neytiri and the ways of the Na'vi, as he begins to understand the spiritual connection the Na'vi have with Pandora. This leads to war between the humans and the Na'vi, with Jake caught in the middle, ultimately choosing the Na'vi side.I had fully expected all of this going into the theater. What I had not expected was finding my heart in my throat more than once, and feeling exhilarated most of the film's very quick 162 minutes. I was more than entertained by ""Avatar."" I was moved.Cameron masterfully uses stunning visual effects and incredible music as devices to achieve this effect on the viewer, but by themselves, these ingredients (although perhaps necessary) are not sufficient. What moved me was the transformation of Jake Sully.Jake's decision to go Pandora is his first step toward becoming something more than he was (his openness to possibility is a step toward hope). He embraces the Na'vi training and is determined to prove himself -- another step (courage, determination, and willingness to become part of something larger than himself, which is a definition of spirituality). He admits his complicity in the plot against the Na'vi -- a third step (integrity). He realizes that he must do something extraordinary to win back the trust of the Na'vi -- riding the terrifying great dragon -- and this is a crucial step (not only bravery, but insight, which is translated into action, and faith). Ultimately, Jake is literally transformed, permanently departing his human body to become Na'vi. He becomes physically and spiritually integrated with the life force of Pandora.Jake's transformation is assisted and encouraged by Neytiri. After Jake regains the trust of the Na'vi, Neytiri acknowledges this by saying ""I see you."" Significantly, she repeats this later in the film, looking into Jake's human eyes. For the Na'vi, ""I see you"" means ""I acknowledge your existence."" The real meaning for Jake is that Neytiri sees him for who he really is, and more importantly, who he can become. It is no coincidence that the song at the end of the film is called ""I See You.""The transformation illustrated so literally in ""Avatar"" is what each of us seeks in life -- a hopeful journey forward, through which we become more than what we were. The journey can be exciting, terrifying, and at times, can challenge us to go beyond what we believed we were capable of doing. Cameron's real achievement in ""Avatar"" is communicating that message without letting the audience know that he is doing it.Especially at this time in history, with the economy depressed, world politics ominous and uncertain, and opportunities for the young seemingly absent, ""Avatar"" delivers a message of encouragement and hope in a medium familiar and acceptable to young adults. For this, Cameron deserves more than an Academy Award. He deserves the Nobel Prize."
"What a waste of money, energy, creativity and intelligence. Never before in the history of mankind, were we presented with such an enormous pile of dong disguised as a beautiful and lovely rose. And most people, or sheep, bought it! Have people here lost their minds? Best movie of 2010? Don't we need a story to really feel a movie? To connect to the characters being presented? To stimulate our brain, our intelligence? This ""story"" was a complete rip off of better movies, with better stories and i feel insulted as a moviegoer. Gimme my money back...There, just had to crap :) Feel better now"
"Rarely does Hollywood produce an epic, and rarely do they fall into capable hands. Not since The Lord of the Rings trilogy has there really been a satisfying epic that comes anywhere near the passion and ambition those films had, but Avatar comes damn close. It's not as strong as those films, but it does have strengths, as well as weaknesses.Are there flaws? Yes, but they're forgivable -- at least they were for me. The story and characters are very simple, and the former of the latter delves into familiar territory. However, despite this simplicity, the audience is given enough time to care for each character, especially when all hell breaks loose.James Horner’s the best he’s been in years. He does borrow from his past work, but honestly, if you haven’t listened to Horner’s previous scores, then you’re not missing out on much. There’s plenty of variety and complexity that makes this score soar when the action starts, and give beautiful growth for when we’re venturing around Pandora and having moments between the characters.The visual effects are certainly where Avatar succeeds on every level. The designs and execution are extraordinary. I first saw this in 2D (because, honestly, the film should be able to hold up in any format to be considered a film and not solely an experience), and even on the traditional screen, the visuals do nothing but make jaws drop. Cameron’s imagination is in perfect form here, and here’s hoping he does sequels.To me, the film never felt heavy-handed or hammy. Yes, some of the dialogue leans towards cheese, but it never becomes self-parody, maybe just a nod to the films of Cameron’s past. Despite the multiple parallels to the Iraq War, Blackwater, and Halliburton, this film was written over a decade ago, but these connections give Avatar a resonating power beyond the spectacle it already is.Even though Cameron the writer can undermine Cameron the director, he never loses us along this journey. There’s an immense buildup to the final third of the film, and Cameron’s attention to detail and storytelling more than allow the audience to gasp in awe at everything he pushes to the limit.The performances are well done. Stephen Lang stands out as the best of them all, he really does a great job at making Colonel Quartich one hell of a villain. Sam Worthington stole the show in Terminator: Salvation and he works that similar magic here. Zoe Saldana is also very intense and engaging in her role, especially when conflicts arise. Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were believable through and through; no one gave less than 100%.All in all, everything worked in Avatar for me. I love the look, and whenever the audience was supposed to cheer, I cheered. At work, those who’ve seen the film loved it, so I’m hoping this word-of-mouth continues at the box office so we get more sequels of this caliber (maybe even higher). Not since The Lord of the Rings has there truly been a worthwhile epic in any genre, and Avatar could shape up to be a juggernaut should there be a bright future for it."
"I never like this movie bcoz I watched ant bully before this but I love the animation, creative scenes.
I am disappointed with James Cameron why he copied from children's book or movie this not showing. And the world still don't know."
"My fiancé and I bought this while on vacation for something to watch in our hotel room, figuring after all the rave reviews that it would be a solid choice. By the end, the two of us were slack-jawed - not by the effects, which, granted, were very visually attractive, but by how a movie so formulaic, so full of ridiculous clichéd one-dimensional characters and simplistic dialogue, could be the talk of the world. James Cameron has an amazing eye for aesthetics, but he seriously need to find someone with a gift for writing scripts, specifically engaging dialogue. Everything about the plot, from Sigourney Weaver essentially reprising a watered down version of her role in Gorillas in the Mist to an evil army commander who reminded me of a sad caricature of every 'ignorant, war hungry army guy' ever made, the characters just... don't matter. It's saddening that this movie is sliding by on its visuals to such a high rating. If you want to watch the exact same story, only with more moving dialogue and far less bloat, rent Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest. Cameron pretty much ripped off the entire plot from it, anyway. I dread the sequels..."
"I knew from the trailer it would have been a good one, but I didn't know how much I would love it. My idea of a good movie is the essence of something that has originality, insatiable acting and a whimsical storyline, something that I couldn't come up with myself. This movie really had me thinking of the possibility of another world like this one. James Cameron; the writer and director of this film found a way to create a mystical plot, beyond anyone's imagination unto the screen for us to enjoy and lament upon. Even the love story is unique and sensational, beyond words.I immediately did research upon returning from the movies, because I really enjoyed this one. I learned about the techniques used to digitize each actor and actress into their 'Na'vi' form and the exceptionally attractive artwork. I further discovered that the writer behind this movie had it set for release in 1999, but held it off until now because the technology introduced would not be as open to us now. We have seen many movies that presented technology that literally left you flabbergasted at the endeavor to create something beyond belief, but 'Avatar' would take your breath away.The names and the language within the movie would leave you wondering whether this language was 'the real deal'. I discovered that the language and culture of the 'Na'vi' was developed by Cameron himself. This creativity and professionalism was presented by Cameron in other films, but this one takes the cake.Set way into the future the plot revolves around the Na'vi and their homeland Pandora. Pandora itself speaks of a box which holds the evils of mankind and once opened, all the evils would be revealed. The choice of Pandora reflects the actual lifestyle of the Na'vi after the humans invaded their homeland.This type of inner depth which director James Cameron chose to develop was what impressed me most. I appreciated the relationship between Neytiri and Jake Sully. Sully himself was simple minded, but according to director Cameron; Sully would be 'a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world'. Very few movies com along like this one often and I was hooked from beginning to end. I remember a particular scene while the humans reigned doom on the Na'vi's and took away their promised tree, I had grown attached to these people so much that their pain was shared and Neytiri's expression and passion for her culture was welcomed with open arms.The Na'vi are essentially a huge family with deep ties among each other. It was amazing how open they were to teach others their traditions and were willing to merge 'an outsider' into their family. I can't grasp officially how the creation of this culture was done off screen, but I could truly believe and accept the possibility of there being a culture like the Na'vi out; a twelve feet tall race open to culture and nature. Their world actually seemed more functional and less complicated than the actual human lifestyle.There were a few inconsistencies within the movie, at least there were a few that others pointed out, that I couldn't have really cared less about. Sometimes when you are so in to a movie you begin to lose any curiosity into plot developments and just 'go with the flow'. There were such few, but the ones pointed out detailed the inability of the Na'vi's arrows to penetrate the flying machines in the first war fight and in the fight with Sully as lead, they easily penetrated the windscreens. My theory in defense of them would be the positions they captured in the first fight; it was weak and unplanned and the distance barely gave any harm, especially since they had no clear view of the screens and aimed relentlessly. A second inconsistency pointed out dealt with the humans' inability to breathe without their masks and then we have them breathing without out their masks in the end. My theory to counter that would entail a bit of uncertainty, but on top of that Cameron did list the possibility of sequel movies and maybe all of those would be explained.If it were me alone none of those mattered at all and the best parts of the movie, which is everything else, made me fall for it deeply beyond words. I would forever cherish one of the best couples created on screen; Neytiri and Sully. I admired the way Neytiri referred to Sully as 'Her Jake', which reenacted their love for each other and made me ignore the possibility for them to be together given Sully's situation. What impressed me further would have been the scene where Sully began to suffocate for air and Neytiri hurried to save him. Despite the fact that she realized his true form, she still loved him; she didn't mind holding a small man in her arms. To her it wasn't a small man, but 'Her Jake', however mushy that sounded.However soon the sequels arrive on screen, I would be one of the many awaiting in hope that they are perceived just as well as the first. I actually began this review a week ago and bit by bit, it came along. I just needed to get the words right and made sure the movie sunk in enough and I love it even more.Lexa Reviews http://lexabuti.blogspot.com ___________Five StarsGrade A++ ___________"
"Avatar was probably the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life. The special effects were jaw-dropping, and i didn't even see the movie in 3-D. But i will go see it for the 3rd time this week, in Imax 3-D.The emotions displayed on the characters faces were incredibly detailed, especially Neytiri. It all looked so real. If i didn't know better, i would of said that they just went to a distant planet and filmed aliens. It looked so real... This was probably the first movie that i actually was disappointed that it ended. i really wanted it to never end. The flying scenes were incredible, and the scenes when the humans interact with the Na'Vi were flawless."
"As I'm writing this, the time is well passed 3 AM, and I don't feel tired at all. I'm on a high that comes from a compelling work of art –the kind of art that leaves a good taste in your mouth. The kind of art where you wake up in the morning and your breakfast tastes better. Yes, I'm on a high, and I may just be an addict, as I would love nothing more than to walk into another screening this very moment.About 12 years ago (about the time that Titanic hit theaters), legendary director James Cameron wrote down a science fiction story that he had, more or less, carried in his head since youth. What Cameron realized right off the bat was that his story, a classical amalgam of influences from My Lai and Wounded Knee to self actualization and the ""reborn"" nature of spirituality, could only achieve cinematic greatness in the manner of its execution, not in the uniqueness of its elements -much the same as Star Wars. What Cameron saw in his head was the important thing, and I'm happy to say that the special effects technology is finally able to catch up to his vision (and probably surpass it). James Cameron's Avatar is nothing short of the most splendid buffet of visuals that my eyes ever did feast upon in a science fiction film.Is the film perfect? Certainly not. There are a few instances of relatively stale dialogue, but never in a distracting way (I'm looking at you Hayden Christenson). Most of the dialogue isn't very quotable in a ""Star Wars"" way either, but then again, Star Wars never had the same level of elegant visual storytelling that Avatar does.Many reviewers have cited 1 dimensional characters: for this I must cry foul. Consistency does not equate to single dimensionality; it is true that most of the characters remain consistent in their moral drive for the duration of the film and most follow well-proved archetypal character journeys, but I fail to see why minimal moral ambiguity is a problem here if it wasn't for Star Wars, The Lion King, Lawrence of Arabia or It's A Wonderful Life. Regardless, the movie is about Sully, and I happen to think that Sully's character was developed in a rich way. It didn't feel ""samey"" to the culture crossover main characters in Last of the Mohicans, Last Samurai, or Dances with Wolves.As for the ""Dances with Wolves"" plot mold of indigenous folks vs. Western greed (the most common ""flaw"" mentioned at rottentomatoes.com), what with the film's ""mcguffin"", unobtainium: natural resources driving the narrative, the story more closely resembles Dune than anything else. And it's executed in such a way that it more fully realizes the story mold than nearly any previous effort; fantastical exaggeration of the symbiotic interdependency between the N'avi and their environment (which they share in a literal, biological way - beyond just food) creates a new benchmark of dramatic urgency in science fiction storytelling.Much of modern sci-fi boringly necessitates pessimism in its narrative to achieve ""respectable"" status, but Cameron beautifully strays from the pack on this outing. Hopeful, spiritual optimism through rich, epic cultural exploration mirrors that found in classics like The Lion King or Lawrence of Arabia. Horner's score emphasizes this as well.The 3D is stunning,never gimmicky, and simply must be seen in Imax.Perhaps when I see Avatar again, I won't like it as well as I do now. Perhaps I must first be sobered from my initial excitement of seeing something crazy and new before I can make an objective analysis worth reading For the moment, I don't care. All I really need to say is: Everyone, see this movie. James Cameron, I see you.(Edit: Saw it again... Still awesome)"
"Everyone told me that this film was great, so i went out of my way & into the cinema ready for some great entertainment. Got a nice ice cream, got a great comfy seat up the back of the cinema and sat through the trailers ready for the much raved about Avatar experience. Put the 3d specs on & soon realized that i had better things to be doing with my time, & walked out. I handed the specs back to the cinema dude, he looked at me as if to say 'you don't like it""? I smiled a reassuring smile thinking to myself that James Cameron deserves to be hung drawn & quartered, and vowed to never trust the common public again. Sitting through this American schmaltz was too much to handle. Avoid at all costs!!"
"The King of the World has returned! Mr. James Cameron's youngest ""Avatar"" is a mind-blowing adventure and the most impressive and intricate work of art, I've ever seen.When his twin brother is killed, disabled ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is recruited to aid a mining expedition on the distant jungle moon of Pandora as only his DNA will bond with the alien hybrid body, known as an Avatar, that allows humans to breathe the toxic air. With orders to infiltrate the Na'vi, Jake finds himself falling in love with native girl, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).""Avatar'"" was created twelve years ago by Cameron, but was ahead of its time. Cameron had to shelve the project and wait for technology to catch up to the script he had written. In 2005 Cameron thought he was close enough to push the technology to tell the story he always wanted to tell and went back to work. It cost Jim blood, sweat and tears and of course a lot of money, but the result is just fascinating, mesmerizing. Money well spent.I am really happy that the movie turned out great. Not just for Jim's sake or because it had been a while since I'd seen a really good movie, but because of all the ""Avatar"" haters out there. All of those people who were trashing the movie before even watching it. They didn't give the movie a chance and let everyone believe that the movie was going to be really bad.Well, they were all wrong and I hope they are honest enough to admit that. OK, maybe the love story wasn't really original, but it worked. However, if the story doesn't work for you, everything else will make up for it. When you watch the movie in 3D it becomes a transcendent and amazing experience that's the closest you will ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. The length of the movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes, but it looked a lot shorter. I wanted more. I just didn't want it to stop. It was that good.I advise them and everyone to give the movie a chance and watch it the way it was mend to be watched, in 3D. You won't regret it!Oh yeah, I almost forgot. When you're watching the movie, it's completely normal to be attracted to Neytiri  Right? Heck even Jim says he's attracted to the Na'vi creatures!"
"I don't understand how some people could criticize this outstanding work of art, i never in my life felt so good watching a movie at the theaters and i didn't even watch it in 3d.I liked all of Cameron's work, especially aliens and terminator 2,titanic was OK but nothing to rage about,but this goes on to a whole different level, the scenes in this movie are incredible,the imagination a person has to have to create a movie like this have to be beyond description,not even district 9 comes close to some of the visuals in this movie, the storyline amazing, what else can you ask for. I've read some comments stating that avatar does not belong in the top 250 movies on IMDb, as its numbered 26th i think,well not only should it belong there i personally think it deserves to take first or second place on IMDb's list for the pure genuine pleasure, and Cameron is ahead of time, he proved it in 1991 with T2 JUDJMENT DAY and he proved it again with AVATAR."
"James Cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better, and he has come close to achieving perfection in his latest production, the marvelous and wonderful ""Avatar"", a film with non stop energy that entertains, teaches, and delights us. Though not completely original, the film shines because its elements all fit into place and take us through experiences which will probably never be matched or surpassed in the silver screen.""Avatar"" is the story of the conflicts between two worlds, one protecting his idyllic environment where everything has a connection to an unifying force and spirit, and another one that continues to self destruct by greed and lack of insight. As we are introduced to the wonders of Pandora, an ironic name if any, the wonders begin. Cameron has given us sights and creations of amazing imagination, with the fauna and flora that parades in front of our eyes, fantastic beings with much more life in them than most of any previous CGI creatures, come to mind the dinosaurs and gorillas of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""King Kong"", but the new animals show more force and agility, and what takes our breath away is how real their interaction appears to be.The crowning jewel are the humanoids native to Pandora, tall and proud blue skinned beings, lovingly rendered by computer programs that rely heavily on the performances of the cast. A million years ahead of the work done with similar process by Zemeckis in the disturbing ""Polar Express"" and ""Christmas Carol"", the people from Pandora manage to express their emotions quite eloquently, and those emotions range from jealousy to heartbreak. Most incredible work is done by Worthington and Saldana, as the central couple who must learn to understand and appreciate each other.Humand eventually try to encroach over the people of Pandora's natural resources, by any means necessary, and a epic battle results because of the destruction of secret sites in order to break the natives' spirits. These are powerful scenes, full of an intensity rarely seen in epic/fantasy films, and the last hour of the film delivers what has sorely been missing from the latest entries by Scott in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and Stone's ""Alexander"", a vibrant and powerful collection of physical confrontations where survival is the key element, spectacle is mixed with sheer will and determination, and the results are magnificent.Finally, I can't heap enough praise upon this sensation movie, the best of 2009, one that is as powerful as ""Departures"", as imaginative and entertaining as ""Star Trek"", full of some of the wonder of ""Up"", and with great performances that recalls the amazing work of Robin Williams in the ""World's Greatest Dad"" and Jessica Biel's and Kristin Scott-Thomas in ""Easy Virtue"", films that like ""Avatar"" are worth a second or third viewing because they aim and hit their respective targets because of their pure cinematic power. How does one know that a film will become a classic? When one leave the theatre and can't wait to see it again for the sum of its parts, not by misreading the power of a single performance and hoping the luster will compensate for the mediocrity of the rest of the film, or by hoping that a set of clever lines will turn a screenplay into gold. Cameron has made sure ""Avatar""'s separate parts all work in tune, from its performances, to its screenplay, to its editing, and special effects, never forgetting that what matters the most is the fact that its heart beats with enough conviction to connect to the sense of wonder in all of us. A great film."
"For all its visual proficiency, ""Avatar"" is not the apex of cinematic achievement some reviewers would have you believe it is, and the primary reason is this: the wobbly script is about as old as cinema itself -- the abundance of flat dialogue like ""You're not the only one with a gun, bitch"" doesn't help either. For this reason (and others discussed below) I still rank Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as superior to ""Avatar"" -- Cameron's film may be technologically superior, but it lacks the intelligence and subtle emotion of Jackson's expertly crafted cinematic trio.""Avatar"" is filled with familiar characters, from the rebellious outsider and hero Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) to noble human scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) to a cartoonish villain (Stephen Lang) invoking the imperialist bloodlust of Bush Cheney Co. to the wise and peaceful Na'vi chief (Wes Studi) and shaman (C.C.H. Pounder) who happen to be parents to the Na'vi princess, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).Neytiri is the sole standout among the film's characterizations as aspiring to something more than cliché: she is not cast simply as Jake's mandatory love interest or the raison d'etre for the switching of his loyalties. She is a fierce warrior, a defender of the environment, and a potent force of nature whose love and life are at the center of the film. The film makers spared no effort in crafting her as authentically as possible; there are moments (i.e. the destruction of the Great Tree, her animalistic cries over the body of her father) when she seems more real (even more human?) than the human characters, which is testimony to the fact that she is the greatest technological achievement in a film boasting of literally millions of special effects and synthetic manipulations. Indeed, when all else about the film may be forgotten, it is her image which persists in the memory, so powerfully is she depicted.It is difficult to watch the onslaught of attacks on the Na'vi without thinking of how closely this scene of unadulterated horror and depraved violence resembles what the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam have endured throughout the U.S. led invasions of those nations. It is clear that Cameron views those invasions as immoral and evil. Should there be any doubts, he has his villain proclaim his desire for ""preemptive attack"" by fighting ""terror with terror."" I wonder what arch conservative Rupert Murdoch (whose Fox produced ""Avatar"") thinks of this not-so-subtle bit of Bush bashing . . .It is impossible -- yes, impossible -- to view the film without thinking of real, historical, flesh and blood Native Americans who lived in North America long before Jamestown was ever a colony. The Na'vi of Pandora are the Native Americans of the 16th and 17th centuries, complete from their tribal lifestyle to the markings on their bodies.To be sure, there is much in ""Avatar"" that borrows from earlier films about Native Americans, namely Disney's animated musical ""Pocahontas"" and the Kevin Costner epic ""Dances with Wolves"". Neytiri IS Pocahontas, and if Jake isn't John Smith, he is most definitely John J. Dunbar/Dances With Wolves. The dominant themes of environmental oneness, natural spirits, and kinship with all of creation abound in stark contrast with the ""human"" values of greed, war, and destruction. Cameron even managed to reincarnate Grandmother Willow as a divine tree called Eywah.The film also delves into the issues of race, genocide, and manifest destiny (admittedly, not always with subtlety or sophistication) in ways that many will decry the film as blatant anti-American propaganda, or as some have described it, as a liberal apology for genocide inflicted upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas by Europeans fueled by white guilt and a visceral hatred of all things neocon. Clearly, much more unfolds on the screen than simply the greatest collection of cinematic visuals you've ever seen.Thus the question naturally arises, is this the definitive mainstream Hollywood film about Native Americans and what they endured under siege of the settlers in the founding years of America? The truth is I do not know. But if what is essentially a popcorn blockbuster can encourage the average film-goer to reassess how they view their place in the natural world and what it really means to invade another nation and unleash war, then Cameron will have far exceeded his goals. What I do know is that ""Avatar"" is an AMAZING piece of entertainment (cheesy dialogue, superficial characterizations and all). You've never seen anything like it -- and likely won't for a long, long time. A definite must-see."
"First, he gave us slimy “Aliens” that Sigourney Weaver battled hard as Ripley. Then the cult hit “Terminator” that created a new benchmark for science fiction and followed it up with the smash hit sequel “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” which initiated many in my generation to Sci-Fi and admiration of Hollywood. “Titanic” mesmerized fans of both SFX and Romance genres while it pushed the envelope for elaborate production design.More than 12 years after “Titanic” comes the most awaited movie of the recent years “Avatar” in which James Cameron has created a whole new Planet Pandora replete with new creatures, predators and humanoid aliens that in every way are beautiful! Well, it did cost him more than 300 million USD to make it and another 100 spent on promotion, but the spectacle that you see on the gigantic IMAX screen in 3D is beyond words!! Set in 2154 and 4 light years away, humans are now exploiting ‘Pandora’ an earth-like moon orbiting a gas giant in Alpha Centauri for an expensive and rare mineral appropriately called ‘unobtanium’. Coming in their way are the indigenous Na’vi who need to be relocated from their ‘home-tree’ that sits on a deposit of unobtainium.RDA, the company has already tried its best to convince the Na’vi to move. They have taught them English and tried offering infrastructure. But, being content in their natural settings, the Na’vi have no interest in what the humans have to offer. English plus business: doesn’t this remind you of European colonization in some sort? The air on Pandora is toxic to humans necessitating the wearing of gas masks outdoors. To get around this, the researchers led by Dr Grace Augustine played by good old Sigourney Weaver have developed an alien-human hybrid ‘Avatar’ that can be mentally controlled by the brain of the person whose DNA was used to build it. Here, the idea of jacking into a computer generated digital-self will surely remind you of “The Matrix”!The death of his researcher brother in the Avatar program leads to his paraplegic ex-Marine brother Jake Sully joining up the Avatar program. Played by Sam Worthington of Terminator Salvation fame, Jake is happy using his Avatar that gets him to use his legs. Soon, he befriends the tree living Na’vi and its huntress princess Neytiri. Learning their ways during the day, Jake returns to debrief his trigger-happy boss, Colonel Quaritch.Soon Jake begins to appreciate the harmony and spiritual connection the Na’vi have with nature and falls in love with Neytiri, much to the dismay of Quaritch who attacks the home-tree. Though the script was written a decade ago, I believe Cameron has subtly hit out at the recent American battles for oil that the administration justified in dubious ways. For those who say the script is poor, take this quote from Jake Sully “When people are sitting on stuff you want, you make them your enemy”. Thought provoking indeed! Visual effects are Avatar’s forte as it creates a new world before you. Filmed in blank sets with motion capture, the actors had to act out without ever knowing what it would look like on screen. Sensors on the Actors’ body and spots on their faces picked up moves and emotions bringing the CGI characters to life. To bring his actors up to speed, Cameron took them to jungles in Hawaii to bring them up to speed on jungle life. 60% of Avatar is CGI with only 40% being real footage. What you’re left with is a WOW! While you may not see Zoe Saldana as Neytiri anywhere in its 162 minutes, the nimble ballet trained actor worked hard to make her character so endearing and realistic. The scenes where she trains Jake in the art of war are its best, be it bonding with the Ikran that seems like a flyer straight from ‘Jurassic Park’ or riding Pa’li the hairless horse.The biggest blame that Avatar can take is that its story is too predictable. Man recruited to fight, falls for the local culture and turns his guns around; just as you saw in “The Last Samurai”. But, making Avatar cool are its special effects that seem so real in IMAX 3D.Emotion seekers and script blamers can’t really deny the story’s soft side when you see the Na’vi suffer human attack and they die fighting for nature we have scant respect for. For one, Na’vi lived for everything we don’t. Politically too, the battle takes a dig on the suffering the Native Red Indians went through in the country that Hollywood comes from.On Music, James Horner’s score doesn’t really stand out and has his ‘Troy’-esque feel. Probably, a score that doesn’t stick out as a sore thumb is good enough in a movie that’s all about special effects. As for Cameron and Horner, this is their third venture together after ‘Aliens’ and ‘Titanic’ with the latter giving him his first and only Oscar honors.As a director, James Cameron doesn’t need a critic’s recommendation. He dropped out of college and drove trucks, but Cameron is the super benchmark movie maker with truly gifted imagination and commitment to translate his dreams to the screen. You simply can’t ask for more from a sci-fi movie at least for a few more years to come! The least I can do with my review is to give it a 10/10. What are you waiting for? Go pull out your newspapers or log on to the web, check show times for 3D and book your tickets now! An IMAX would be even better. Believe me, it’s a bang for your buck!"
"For the first time in my life as a writer, I won't be writing a lengthy paragraph.When I saw the movie, I cried for two reasons. One, because I am also an artist, and the sheer beauty of its digital imagery stunned me to tears. Second, with a lesson in environmental concern, the simple story of a lost tribe and their survival moved me so much. I fell in love with such imaginary, admirable characters (both human and Navi). I fell for a sci-fi story with a heart.So allow me this reluctance to elaborate further. You just have to see it to believe it. Believe that you are in Pandora even for two fleeting hours, and it will be more than worth the trip.Thank you, James Cameron. Once again, you are king of the world."
"Avatar is a movie about two races, usually covering both the human and another race on another planet. Its simply outstanding, it has a plot, it has a structure, it has effects that are done so excellently, you'd definitely imagine yourself in the movie. Learning how to talk, learning how to feel nature, learning how to fly and heroic love, all of these are all present.Loved it, loved it, simply loved it.The cast is simply mixed but appropriate. The lady from aliens plus some new talents add to the already excellent finished product.The musical score is simply beholding. You get into the music and it rocks the whole time you are in the theater.Overall, and for all of the above facts, I give it a 10 vote!"
"You wanna know something funny? Not even a year ago, early 2009, I was watching ""The Directors"" on the Reelz Channel and James Cameron was on. I was talking to my friend and saying how he is one of my favorite directors, he has an amazing track record of great movies, but wait, has he done anything since Titanic? I went on the net to check to see what he has done since Titanic and it says nothing but documentaries and he was working on a film called Avatar. I read a little about the movie and then a few months later came the trailer and I was just in awe. I was extremely curious to see this movie and couldn't wait as when we hear the name James Cameron, you can't help but expect nothing but greatness. The man is a perfectionist and it shows, he always goes above and beyond what he needs to do for a film and we got that with Avatar. My only complaint being like Titanic, the story not being the most original on the market, but I can't at all hate this movie. Originally wanting give this movie a 9 rating, I find myself thinking that I can't. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen in my life. My boyfriend and I saw this in 3D and I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. James Cameron is back and I hope he never leaves Hollywood again as this was the breath of fresh air that we needed with Avatar.In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and use gas masks. In an attempt to improve relations with the natives, scientists create human-Na'vi hybrids called avatars, controlled by genetically-matched human operators. Jake Sully, a former marine, becomes a last-minute replacement for his murdered identical twin brother, a scientist trained to be an avatar operator. Dr. Grace Augustine, the head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother, and relegates him to a bodyguard role. Jake escorts Augustine and biologist Norm Spellman on an exploratory mission in their avatar forms to make contact with the Na'vi in order to help establish diplomatic relations, solve the problem of resources and end the threat of violence. The group is attacked by a predator, and Jake becomes separated and lost. Forced to survive the night in Pandora's dangerous jungles, he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Neytiri brings Jake to Hometree, which is inhabited by Neytiri's clan, the Omaticaya. Mo'at, the Na'vi shaman and Neytiri's mother, shows interest in the warrior ""Dream-walker"", and instructs her daughter to teach Jake their ways.I had another fellow IMDb user e-mail me a week ago asking me about my thoughts on the movie and he informed me that Cameron has been working on the story for years(many thanks to oldman007 for the info) and just now had the opportunity to work on it. I think that Cameron did a great thing by taking a break from movies as not only could he retire a good 25 times from the money he made on Titanic but we had an opportunity to appreciate him even more for Avatar. 2009 was kind of a lousy year for films and this was the movie that we needed to have that sigh of relief. From the actors, the special effects, the visuals, and the way the story is told was orchestrated like a perfect night at the theater with an standing ovation from the audience as everyone wanted more despite the 150 minute running time.I'm sure Avatar is sure to be in for the run during Oscar time, wither it gets a best picture nod or not, I'm not sure, but from what I've seen this does deserve every award it can get. I feel very bad if I'm over hyping the film too much for you, I don't want people to get the wrong idea that this is the Casablanca of the new millennium, but it really was just a relief that we still have potential in Hollywood to put out a great movie. Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana stole the show and I think the reason being is because Cameron can make females very strong, beautiful, but doesn't over do it with his actresses and always knows what he wants from them and they deliver. Sam Worthington as the leading man, Jake, I was a bit worried as I saw Terminator: Salvation which was like spitting in James Cameron's face, he was the star in that film too and I thought he was going to just suck the life out of this film. Thankfully I was wrong and he pulled in a strong enough performance to carry the film with some incredible actors beside him. Avatar is very much worth the look on the big screen, it's a masterpiece.10/10"
"Avatar, undoubtedly an amazing experience, will redefine the boundaries of modern cinema. The magnum opus of the master craftsman James Cameroon delivers magical screen realization to innovative imagination. It took over a decade for the fast-paced technology to catch up to brilliant imaginations of James Cameroon.It is the movie of the decade in terms of cinematic imagination (even crossing the earlier standards set by LOTR trilogy) and movie of the generation in terms of CG. The advantage of Avatar is that the movie not only revolves around the hype of $300 million and IMAX 3D, but has an involving political statement. It brings into light, three major issues. Firstly, the movie itself stands as metaphor of the US invasion of Iraq. Secondly it unveils imperialism's cold blooded face in disrespecting and demolishing cultures. Lastly it has a profound green political statement that insists on bio-diversification. Even though it doesn't indulge itself into individualist philosophies, Avatar is not philosophically void. It is illuminated (like the illuminating insects and plants of Pandora) by the philosophy of universal identity believed by the Na'vi tribe. The concept of Eywa really matches with the base theory of coexistence of many human civilizations. Some may say story of Avatar is old wine (pointing Dances with wolves, The Last Samurai and all). But, the invasion on aboriginal cultures and human civilizations by imperialist powers is repetitive - it happened during civil war, it happens in Iraq. So the story isn't loosing its relevance but deserves the retelling.But beyond all this, the breathtaking visuals will steal the show and will surely leave you with a once in a lifetime cinematic experience. The thrilling action sequences in sky, mammoth animals , legendary Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora, and scenes in which Jake tames the flying dragon bird -Mountain Banshee and biggest creature in sky -Toruk, all leaves a mark in history of cinematic visuals. It is the CG that even shadows the 3D. but don't miss the show in 3D as not seeing this movie in 3D will be the greatest loss. Hats off to the one man - James Cameroon, who imagined the unimaginable and realized the impossible. Avatar makes the sci-fi cinema so far, paraplegic as the protagonist Jake Sully in human form and a new era of visual entertainment starting from this movie, as mind blowing as the blue Avatar itself."
"I must admit I had my doubts about this movie when I saw it in previews a couple months ago. I really didn't know what to think of the movie then. I saw this movie twice, the first time in regular 2d and the second in 3d. I have to say I was simply astonished at the visuals in this movie. Some scenes do tend to ""pop"" out a little more than others, but I was simply transfixed and awestruck not only at the incredible look of the movie but of the storyline itself. This movie really makes one think about life and how we might not be the only ones in the universe. Science fiction usually brings about thoughts on this, but we do have the ""Kepler probe"" already out there looking for another habitable planet, that isn't science fiction but is a reality. This movie also brings up another incredible aspect humans have struggled with. Humor me and go along with me for a minute - If a hundred or so years from now the human race had actually found another habitable planet and there was a less-advanced civilization living on it. Could our race be civil and humanitarian on the ways we try to establish contact? Would establishing contact really be the best thing to do? This movie might also seem quite similar to the early colonizers coming overseas from Europe to North America. Where the humans symbolize the prospecting company and the natives symbolize the Navi. This movie really does have a lot more going for it than just stunning visuals. I myself think this movie is the best sci-fi yet. I might even be bold enough to say that this could be the new ""Star Wars"" of our generation."
"You put your glasses on and you're in. A feast for the eyes at least for the first hour. The brain, however, remains asleep. How strange that such an ambitious enterprise could ignore its most important aspect, the story. A rehash of other things with dialogues from a high school play. Also, very self referential. The bitch! from Aliens truly omnipresent. I was surprised Sam Worthington didn't say ""I think I've seen an iceberg"" or maybe he did say it while I conceded myself a little nap - after the second hour - So here we are, facing a film future in 3D"" I will, still, long for characters in movies, people I can, not just relate, but be inspired by, thought provoking and all the rest that goes with it. So, Cameron did it again and if money is at the center of the world, he remains ""king of the world"""
"12 years ago, James Cameron had a vision of Avatar in mind. A vision so ahead of its time that Cameron shelved his project in order to wait for the technology to catch up. A vision so imaginative & exciting that he, finally, went on to create the much needed technology on his own. And the end result was NOT disappointing at all. Avatar takes film-making technology to a whole new level & sets a new standard in 3D viewing. It's a milestone in the history of the art.Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders & protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism & biodiversity. Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. So, watch it in 3D cinemas only if you really want to experience the breathtaking vision of Cameron's world.Director James Cameron has, once again, broken all boundaries & created a visual extravaganza, thus, in the process, announcing his return which just couldn't have been better. From Terminator to Aliens to The Abyss to Terminator 2 to Titanic & now Avatar, the entertainment scope is getting wider & wider with every Cameron's film without compromising at all with the quality. The attention he has given to the detail is superb. Not only Cameron created a whole new world with its flora & fauna of exceptional beauty, he went on to create the culture, race & language of the Na'vi too & their love for their surroundings. They are to Pandora what humans are to Earth. Only difference being our ignorance to our surroundings.Avatar isn't an exceptional movie, overall. When it comes to plot, performances or dialogs, its a disappointment. Those things are no match to Cameron's previous works; Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2 & even Titanic. The reason behind Avatar breaking every box-office records lies in the beauty of Avatar that's drawing people to theaters again & again. The unforgettable experience in 3D viewing, the dead-end beauty of Pandora, the never-seen-before film-making technology & much satisfying entertainment overall are all responsible for its grand success. It has started the change. It has set things in motion. Cinema is getting revolutionized. Almost every movie is going 3D these days because of Avatar. Still, none have been able to recreate that same magic or experience. That's why, Avatar is way ahead of it's time.Now, let's come to the strong points of Avatar. It lies in its visual effects, editing & cinematography. Editing, like any Cameron movie, is brilliant. The cinematography brings us closer to the beautiful environment, the exotic creatures & incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora. Those who watched it in 3D knows how heartwarming the feeling was to find yourself in the flora & fauna of Pandora. However, the backbone of Avatar is its visual effects. Groundbreaking from scene 1, it's not the surroundings but the details of the surroundings because of which Visual Effects of Avatar reached new heights. World's 2 greatest visual effects studios, ILM & Weta Digital, worked together to produce this gem, and the results are wonderful. The attention in detailing & the magnitude scale of Pandora are sure to leave viewers jaw-dropped. Just the detailing on the face of a Na'vi is enough to tell you about the dedication involved in its making.Technically, Avatar is a breakthrough in film-making technology, 3D viewing & stereoscopic film-making with camera being designed specifically for the movie. If one looks at the story, it isn't that bad too. Of course not the best or even among the best, but still, it has all elements of entertaining the general audience of the world & that's what this movie is doing right now. At least, James Cameron knows how to invest and properly use the massive budget of this movie, unlike Michael Bay(Transformers 1 n 2) or Roland Emmerich(2012, Godzilla etc) who rely only on VFX & nothing else. At least, Avatar scores pretty well above them. It tells a fine story & let VFX n SFX take this movie to new heights.James Horner collaborated with James Cameron for the 3rd time (after Titanic & Aliens) & no doubt, has given a brilliant soundtrack yet again. The score is not as epic as Titanic but is still excellent for a sci-fi film. The score is really beautiful & succeeds in creating the music culture for the alien race. The beauty of the music of Avatar blends well with the beauty of Pandora. James Horner has done a fantastic job.Also, the story or screenplay of Avatar won't make it to the great lists. So, its better you go without expecting a quality plot & screenplay from this movie but a feast for the eyes. And make sure you watch Avatar in 3D for an all new experience. You won't regret it. Missing Avatar would be like missing a turning point in cinema. So be a part of it.10/10 for Avatar's beauty & the wonderful experience I had in theater."
"This movie actually blew my mind! I have to admit that it's quite easy to impress me, but when i left the cinema I was just amazed by the feelings this film left. First of all to say is that the visual effects and the whole setting of this movie is absolutely unique yet and will be for a few years still, I think. The Sorrounding on ""Pandora"" doesn't let you breathe for several minutes in which you just cannot close your mouth. But this is NOT what makes this movie unique and so awesome! The story is really a great part of it, and gives the film its spirit. OK, it IS predictable, but many tiny parts that are unexpected just give it the suspense it needs. This is no ""switch off your brain""-movie!!!In my opinion this film is worth 9-10 stars, I'm giving 10 for the goose-flesh it still gives me every time I see the trailer or hear the soundtrack. This evening I'm gonna watch it again :-)PS: Sorry for my bad English, I'm from Germany..."
"This movie is perhaps one of the most spectacular I have ever seen. Throughout all three hours or so, I was held spellbound by the scenery, action, and storyline of James Cameron's dream. I do not think I glanced at my watch once throughout it, and I can honestly say that I didn't want it to end.First: the visual effects were absolutely stunning. James Cameron did not just create a world; he created an entire ecosystem that could be plausible if we didn't know better. The first time the Na'vi were seen, the person I was with leaned over and asked me if they were costumes or special effects, they were that real. The Hallelujah Mountains looked amazing, and the wildlife, although it would be frightening in real life, was just stunning.Second: the themes were great. Although stone-hearted critics (like the ones on here who gave it a 1/10) may argue that it was unoriginal and a direct copy of other movies, there are very few movies coming out nowadays that you couldn't say that about. I noted themes in this from several different movies, the most prominent being Dances with Wolves, but that wasn't the only one. It also took a theme out of real life: people destroying the environment for such petty things as money. The reality of it is one of the most disturbing things in that film.Third: the storyline was great. It does have similarities to Dances with Wolves, but there was so much more to it than that that you really could not say they were the same thing. Dances with Wolves did not go into the training nearly as much as this did. There are several others, but I won't name them all.Basically, this film is about as epic as you can get, and shame on all of you who think it was bad because it took themes from other movies and enhanced them. You will never find a movie that doesn't."
"BEST MOVIE IN YEARSi was blown away by how good this was and have now seen it 3 times at the cinema, this is a MUST see movie for everyone. It runs for around 2.40mins but i would have loved it to be longer. Everything in the movie is perfect from the acting to the story to the special effects! When the film first starts you will be thrown straight into the story. and from there its a wild ride in a perfect world for the next few hours. James Cameron really did think about everything in this movie, (SPOILERS ALERT) about mid way through the movie there will be an EPIC scene which will make you connect to the Na'vi and will (if you haven't already) fall in love with this film. it really was clever how James Cameron did this and one of the most emotional moments in a Sc-fi film i have ever scene! its beyond me how he made you connect so well to something that is not real but made you want to believe it was (SPOILERS OVER).If you are on the fence about seeing this film, its time to jump over it....MUST SEE 10/10"
"I was a bit hesitant to write a review after my first viewing of Avatar. But now after my third viewing, I am not shy in declaring that this movie will become a classic and remembered for its groundbreaking vista for as long time. We have become used to ""production"" movies coming out of assembly lines from Hollywood, Bollywood, Asian and European movie houses that we almost forgot how wonderful a cinematic experience can be. Sure, there may have been other movies this year with ""more quirky"", ""more original"" stories but as a whole, Avatar is by far the best movie this year and in the top ten of best movie this decade. A classic is by definition something that you can enjoy as much if not more in the second, third, fourth viewing, and Avatar is definitely it. I don't understand the critic that this film lack story and emotion because it has all of it, even if a bit on the cliché side."
"Reading through most of the reviews, people have graded it to what the movie deserved ""a high rating"". Though some people refused to consider it a great movie, mostly because it lacked in originality and did not live up to its extremely high expectations. To be honest the movie really wasn't revolutionary, it was just really good. Thus I still insist on giving it a good rating. The movie followed the same concept as many previous movies, being that mankind is evil and are aggressive consumers of worlds. The movie kind of represents symbolism for both the indigenous people being forced out of their land (Like the Colonist/ Indian conflict). It also represents our war in the sense that our ambition is a war in desire of oil, or supply. Indeed many movies in the past have based their meaning on these subjects, but what is wrong with repetition if the outcome is good? It is how the concepts are composed is what matters. And I believe that if any viewer of Avatar, will drop their boundaries; even a little, will like this movies. Granted the story did not consist of extremely deep meaning compared to the more popular and intellectual movies, but it still proved interesting. I must also add that some of the movies that critics claim Avatar to have stolen from I have not seen, thus I suppose their is an exception to have not liked this movie. Still I enjoyed the story and its' characters.Now as for the visuals, they were better than almost every movie I have seen, but not revolutionary. As I watched previews of this movie I noticed a blend between reality and animation, thus I had a high expectation of the movies' visuals. Unfortunately throughout the movie it was pretty easy to tell when it was animation and when it was not. It was like the matrix in the sense that when Jake entered the alien world you knew it was not real. Perhaps if the Na'vi were not as colorful, and in bright colors, my opinion would be otherwise. Despite that the visuals were still great. I must also point out that in this movie James Cameron has created an interesting and unique world, in which I compare to even Star Wars itself. The Na'vi are basically gargantuan humans with blue skin and elf ears, but still very cool to look at, even to be attracted too ""cough"" Neytiri. The creatures and even the futuristic technology expressed are simply amazing. So another great feature Avatar contains.Critics of this story would argue against its simplicity as it is a well known concept in terms of a war between natives and conquerors, but it doesn't mean the story was bad. Even if you argue that the main conflict lacked originality, James Cameron exposed other intriguing ideas, such as the transfer of ones mind to another body and even the metaphor between the internet and the planets forest. If you can not enjoy this movie, you are too critical and I recommend dropping your boundaries, for I assume you would dislike almost every movie, making your experience in modern entertainment rather dull, despite the exception I mentioned earlier. In truth this movie may not deserve a 10 maybe an 8 or 9, but I give it a 10 to counter those whom give it low ratings for almost ridiculous reasons. I highly recommend seeing Avatar to all people and hope you will enjoy it as much as I have."
I watch movies for a living and feel as though most movies are just rehashes of movies that have already been made. Avatar is different. Cameron has created a new world that I felt I became a part of while watching. The detail is absolutely amazing. All I could think about when watching this movie is how the Native Americans must have felt when the white man came to town. The idea that everything is connected touched home with me. The natives felt such a connection with every thing on their planet. It was so original to have the natives literally connect with the other species on the planet. I must admit that parts of it were predictable but it was so worth the ride.
"I just saw 'Avatar' from sridar,our dear theatre.I was astonished by this movie.James cameron is the most futuristic director ever born in this world & Avatar is the most advanced movie you'll ever come across.I cant think of a world beyond Avatar.It shows you the farthest limit of human imagination.The story & screenplay is so superb that you'll scream out after the movie saying 'I am blessed to see Avatar'.Its a masterpiece in movie-making. Don't compare it with classic dramas.Because all the action in Avatar is happening out of this world.So change the way you think.You'll love this movie.Everything goes well in this movie.The Highlight being the special effects.The world 'Pandora' is amazingly beautiful.Sam worthington cements himself to the big league.Joe zaldana was also the pick out.Nice background music thanks again to James horner.All i have to say is three words, Hip Hip Hurray........ 10/10........"
"James Cameron is a force of nature. His movies have an all-encompassing, ambient power of their own. The kind of power that makes a James Cameron movie a bigger deal than everything else. Avatar is his biggest yet. Every Cameron trope is out in full force: Bad-ass chicks, space marines, over-the-top action, and a sweeping love story. Avatar is in many ways an amalgamation of everything that makes James Cameron a unique voice in Hollywood. Elements of Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, and Titanic are distilled here into a visionary masterwork of classic epic filmmaking and cutting-edge technology.Avatar's ambitious story follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) as he travels to the rainforest planet of Pandora to replace his late brother in the Avatar program, which allows certain humans to inhabit a body that resembles that of Pandora's native humanoids, the Na'vi. The leader of the program, Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), hopes to use avatars to peacefully interact with the natives. Meanwhile, others, including the greedy CEO, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) and the military leader, Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) look to exploit the Na'vi for a precious resource called unobtanium. Jake Sully is caught between these two worlds when he meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a blue-skinned Pocahontas who introduces him to her culture.Jake's inner conflict drives Avatar's story, and structurally, it works. Yes, it borrows a lot from Dances with Wolves. Learning from and becoming part of another culture is nothing new, but Avatar presents this classic tale in a fresh way. As a paraplegic, Sully's avatar allows him freedom. It gives him a genuine reason to view Na'vi life as an opportunity to start anew. I can buy it. And once the two sides of him finally clash, the power of that conflict really hits. It's a tangibly large story. Epic and engrossing. The effectiveness of that simple story, well told, of connecting with your supposed enemies is why I resent the disingenuous love story Cameron decided to put front and center.Before I get to the lavish praise of Avatar, which I consider one of the most special movie experiences of the century, I must address my one nagging grievance. The love story, the Neytiri character, and all the preachy ""bio-spiritual"" fluff that comes with her, irked me. James Cameron has never been known for subtle characters, and Avatar doesn't change that. Dr. Augustine is a tough-talking scientist with a penchant for cigarettes, Colonel Quaritch is a hard-as-steel military grunt with a giant scar across his face, and the CEO practices golf in his office. The point is, these are bold-faced archetypes. Neytiri is no different. She's a tree-hugging, flower-power philosopher. That's fine, but Zoe Saldana's performance has none of Stephen Lang's towering vitality or Weaver's cool confidence. It's all screeching and posturing. She's shrill and angry, and her spirituality quickly devolves into a full-on castigation of the evils of military conquest and deforestation. Shouldn't this spiritual guide be a little more even-keeled? I never believed that Jake would fall for her. Compared to Cameron's other movie romance, Titanic, Avatar seems manufactured. Neytiri is less a character than she is a face on which to pin the movie's heavy-handed message.With that out of the way, let's get to what makes Avatar the single most monumental cinematic achievement of this generation. James Cameron creates, in Pandora, the most rich, realistic, and fully realized fictional world in the history of cinema. From a design standpoint alone, the imagination ingrained in the animals, plants, and vehicles is absolutely staggering. Pandora is miles ahead of everything else in terms of diversity of life, and what's really astounding is that with all these varied alien elements, Cameron somehow makes this place real. From the high-tech, lived-in military bases to the elaborate Na'vi culture, with its palpable sense of history, Cameron's attention to detail in Avatar is revolutionary.So too are his technical innovations. The movie is remembered most for it's pioneering use of 3D, and rightfully so. Implemented alongside the uncanny photo-realism of the Na'vi's, the creatures, the mountain-sized trees, and the bio-luminous plants, the 3D is more transporting than anything I have ever seen. All the superlatives in the world can't completely do justice to the Weta team that brought Cameron's gargantuan vision to reality, so I won't bother. The truly commendable aspect of Avatar is not that the special effects are so sophisticated, but that you forget that what you are watching are indeed special effects. Avatar uses 3D to immerse rather than amuse. You are absorbed in the world of Pandora so completely, that it cuts across the divide we have with most films. You don't watch Avatar, you live it, feel it, experience it.That feeling of absolute immersion is what defines Avatar. It's a movie, with plot, characters, and a story, but that stuff doesn't matter as much as the physical sensation it creates of actually being in a brand-new world. It's true, Jake Sully is less important than Pandora. But those who dismiss Avatar as simply ""pretty pictures"" are undervaluing the impact of James Cameron's image-making. Avatar creates visuals and utilizes technology so well, it makes the audience feel like part of the film. Some people take for granted just how significant that is. Others take for granted James Cameron's direction. Here is the single most ambitious movie ever conceived, and Cameron handles it all with the confidence of a world-class chef. This guy is not intimidated by anything. He is an elite director; the world's leader in action and world-building, and miraculously, he keeps getting better! Avatar is his most accomplished film.Avatar's success lies in its ability to engross every kind of moviegoer. Science fiction geeks and action aficionados can revel in some of the most thrilling action scenes ever put to film (The final battle alone is more exciting than 99% of blockbusters before or since), sentimental romantics can connect to the classic story, and even those who don't connect to either can experience the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of visiting Pandora. James Cameron has made a picture that defies comparison. There is not another movie that reverberates with the ethereal power of Avatar. Because Avatar is beyond movies. The film is overwhelming; An event imagined and shot on a scale bigger and bolder than anything I've seen. Assisted by James Horner's majestic score and Mauro Fiore's epic cinematography, Avatar totally envelopes us in an exotic world. An original masterwork of popular entertainment, Avatar deserves its spot as the biggest hit in movie history. This is truly Cameron's magnum opus, a movie that burns with boundless passion. A classic that thrills as it inspires awe.93/100"
"I've read many reviews on IMDb from other users about how this film was poor quality; how the plot is shared with many other films and how predictable the plot of this film was. And yes, i do agree that the plot was rather predictable, but this in no way ruins the film! James Cameron made what can only be described as a masterpiece. Spectacular visual effects, tremendous acting from the talented cast, and a plot that makes the film what it is: thoroughly enjoyable.Negative reviews I've read include a totally predictable plot. I can name a fair few other films that have had a predictable plot, and haven't had any reviews reporting the plots predictability. lord of the rings - Frodo was going to make it. The matrix - Neo is the One. The Star Wars prequels - eventually Anakin was going to turn bad. Oh, and just about every James Bond film ever made = Bond kills the bad guy, saves the world.Relating the film to others like Dances with Wolves? OK, this i shall allow, as the plot is quite similar in some aspects, but this is as far as the similarities go.What I've not seen in reviews panning this film is Avatar's relation to the problems we are yet to face. The film describes our need to venture away from our own planet to fight the energy crisis taking place on earth, bringing us to Pandora. The mineral on Pandora, named 'unobtainium', is what the humans are after, and Cameron does an incredible job of showing through the film just how desperate us as humans could be to get energy that we could use in such a crisis: willing to wipe out the planets indigenous population and drive them away from their home, showing we resort to inhuman acts to satisfy our own needs. This contrasted with problems we have had in the past (driving native Americans out of their homes and off their land to benefit ourselves) presents us with an incredible plot. The problems of our future contrasted with the problems of our past presented in a visually stunning movie.People giving this film a review of less that an least 8/10 stars clearly need to wake up, and realises that this film DOES re-invent movie making.Welcome back James Cameron, we've missed you!"
"What to say? What to say about this movie ? Its very difficult for me to explain how good the movie was. Excellent Movie. Excellent Direction. Superb CGI Effects. Very good acting especially from Stephen Lang as Col. Miles Quaritch. This movie will be a sure Oscar winner.As the movie goes - In AD 2154, a human corporation mines Pandora, the lush, low gravity moon of Polyphemus, one of three gas giants that orbit Alpha Centauri A, 4.4 light-years (280,000 AU) from Earth. The humans seek to exploit Pandora's reserves of a precious mineral called unobtanium. Parker Selfridge , the head of the mining operation, employs former marines and soldiers as mercenaries.Pandora is inhabited by an indigenous paleolithic species of sapient humanoids called the Na'vi. Humans are unable to breathe Pandora's atmosphere, which is rich in carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia, and peaceful interaction with the Na'vi is difficult. Human researchers led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) create the Avatar Program, genetically engineering human-Na'vi hybrids. A human who shares genetic material with an avatar is mentally linked to it, allowing them to control it while their own body 'sleeps'. These avatars cost millions to produce and link, so gaining access to one is difficult. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a former Marine who was paralyzed below the waist in combat on Earth. His twin brother, Thomas, was a scientist working in the Avatar Program; when Thomas is killed, Jake takes his brother's place because he is genetically compatible with his brother's avatar. Dr. Augustine is less than happy about Jake being there, as he has no knowledge of Na'vi culture and has never used an avatar. (In contrast, his brother had a doctorate and years of training to participate in the program.) Jake's first assignment is to escort Dr. Augustine and a biologist named Norm Spellman through the hostile jungle. The group is attacked by a thanator, a large predator, and Jake becomes separated from the others, forcing them to leave him behind for the night. Jake attempts to survive in his avatar body, fending off dangerous creatures. This attracts the attention of a female Na'vi named Neytiri who rescues Jake. Although, at first, she is troubled by Jake's recklessness, when some floating seeds are attracted to him she sees it as a spiritual sign from Eywa . She takes him to the Na'vi Hometree, the spiritual and geographical home of her clan. The Na'vi decide to teach Jake about their culture.Jake is ordered by Colonel Miles Quaritch on a diplomatic mission to obtain the trust of the Na'vi clan and is given three months to convince them to abandon their Hometree, which sits above a large deposit of unobtanium. As Jake learns the way of the Na'vi, he gradually finds himself caught between the military-industrial forces of Earth and a newfound love for his adopted home and people. AJake is successfully initiated into the tribe after passing the Omaticaya rites of passage to become a Man. Neytiri and Jake choose each other as mates, much to the jealousy of Tsu'Tey , heir to the chieftainship of the tribe who was originally chosen as Neytiri's mate. Jake keeps silent on the human's plans to use force if the Na'vi will not leave peacefully, but when the deadline runs out, a bulldozing machine comes to begin destruction and almost kills Jake and Neytiri. He saves them both by destroying the camera and sensors on the machine.Jake pleads for another chance to convince them to leave and is given one hour by Selfridge. When he reveals his mission to the Na'vi, they feel betrayed by him and they leave him for dead when the hour runs out. Jake stirs the Na'vi to war with the assistance of Neytiri and Tsu'Tey, now the newly appointed chief of the clan. Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other tribes to battle the human forces. Colonel Quaritch, seeing that the Na'vi are growing in numbers, orders a preemptive attack to destroy the Tree of Souls, the center of Na'vi religion and culture.As the battle begins, the Na'vi put up a formidable defense under Jake's leadership, but take heavy casualties, including Tsu'Tey, Trudy, and Norm's avatar. When all hope seems lost, the Pandoran wildlife suddenly launch a mass attack, overwhelming the humans. Neytiri interprets this as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Colonel Quaritch orders the Tree of Souls bombed, but Jake destroys the bombing shuttle before the explosive is launched.Quaritch's gunship is destroyed, but he manages to escape in his AMP (Amplified Mobility Platform) suit. As he proceeds to the Tree of Souls in order to destroy it, he finds the Avatar interface field pod Jake's compatriots had moved and decides to assault it to kill the human Jake. Neytiri, who was riding on a Thanator and Jake's avatar arrive to defeat him, but not before the pod sustains serious damage, exposing Jake to Pandora's toxic atmosphere. Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake, seeing his human form for the first time. Then they fall in love for each other.Defeated, the humans are forced to leave Pandora, while Jake and his friends are allowed to remain. As the humans leave, Jake is seen wearing the insignia of the Omaticaya clan leader. The film ends with Jake's soul being transplanted from his human body to his Na'vi avatar at the Tree of Souls; his breathing mask is removed from his human body, indicating that the transplant is permanent Jake now starts his new life as a Na'vi.So, Hats of to James Cameron - You are great. I am waiting for its SEQUEL.Everybody should watch this. The film is directed by a master director"
"How can people always find something to complain about even for the best of the best, always amuses me. What's wrong with the Storyline? Ya, it is something that we have seen before.. No.. I am not referring to the past movies with similar story lines.. I am talking about those Natives in America, Aborigines in Australia, the natives of Africa, the countries oppressed by Colonial England, the oppression of communist China.. The greed of corporates and governments that killed millions of people because they were the dominant ones at that point in History! Yes, where we have seen this story before is in our History as humans!Well, when someone is making the most expensive film of the century and pours all his passion and imagination into it, I am proud of James Cameron that he chose this Storyline and not some silly Military story that glorifies war or a meaningless rambling about the significance of an old and irrelevant book! He knew his movie was going to be watched with passion the world over... What better message can he convey to the world with his movie than saying, men and women of the future! you better see this movie.. Remember all the sins your forefathers committed in this world.. Be compassionate and don't ever do it again!I would say this to the haters who complain about the lack of originality or the lack of emotional strength. The movie does move you if you are prepared to be moved. The movie conveys a message if you want to listen to it! If you think there is no message or that you are not moved, then it is because you do not have the heart to understand. I am sure there are such people in this world. If everyone in this world was compassionate enough to understand this message, why were those sins against humanity committed in the first place!"
"In 1984, he gave us a groundbreaking futuristic thriller in The Terminator. Thirteen years later he gave us the high grossing romantic period piece Titanic. Prior to that, he had the vision for the sheer beauty and amazement of his newest masterpiece, Avatar.I'm sure everyone knew to expect great visuals throughout the movie, but not nearly as much as this. James Camerons new world of Pandora showcases a vast amount of how creatively the mind of this genius works, and why technology couldn't represent it properly until now. Every single detail is carved in such a way that you are left with an abundance of awe from just a quick glance upon the vividly lush screen. Though most films with an abundance of CGI and effects often overlook the acting in the film, Avatar even refuses to make that cliché. Sigourney Weaver is as great as she always is, and simply adds to her accomplishments. Sam Worthington has the perfectly roguish mentality that makes him the perfect choice for the primary role, and Zoe Saldana has made a career for herself this year alone, with her success in Star Trek over the summer and exemplifies her gifted talents with a powerful role here. Th most surprising role in my eyes, however, was that of Michelle Rodriguez as the pilot. For the first time, not only is she given a role that suits her, but she manages to showcase just how good an actress she can be with the right role. While this movie does have its haters, and will obviously continue to do so, one of the most repeated criticisms of Avatar is that it is simply a superfluous futuristic version of Dances with Wolves. I wouldn't necessarily disagree, but do consider this a better film. While the two do have several similarities, the raw emotion infused with grade A technology simply magnify the drama of the plot to an infinite degree. While it is clearly a depiction of the story of American Indians, their life, infiltration, and ultimate loss of home and identity, the obscure version of this tale makes it more impactful on ones mind. The wordplay involved within the film deserves its own applause. From the mineral being called ""unobtanium"", to the name of the planet being ""Pandora"", the foreshadowing of these words just continues to add to the depth of the movie. Despite the fact that I have seen several dramatic, historical, futuristic and action films, I simply cannot recall a better combination of each of these major genres, with humor and emotion in my lifetime. It has been a while, both since Cameron has released a new film an I have anticipated a movie for so long( 3+ years), and both waits were undoubtedly worth it. It also borrows from films such as Dances with Wolves and District 9. Ultimately, Cameron's lesson is perfectly taught, his vision is fully showcased, and this legendary film is undoubtedly a prime candidate for one of the best overall cinematic viewing experiences in modern film history, from visuals to storyline and its telling, along with fine acting and sheer brilliance. A great tale of epic proportions from a directorial mastermind that can match the levels of Scorcese and Welles. 10/10."
"Wow is really the only word to describe this movie. I haven't felt like this after a movie...ever. I left that theater and was disappointed that Pandora wasn't a real place. The land scape is utterly breath taking in every way, it is everything your imagination can imagine and more, amazing in a sense I can't relay to you. I don't care what you have planned or how you can't afford it. Cancel what you have to and find the money! People are saying that the plot is mediocre, trust me, that's not what this film is about. I wish there was more! Even in the 2 and a half hours I was there I felt like I experienced a completely different life/world. Absolutely a must see for anyone with an imagination. SEE THIS IN 3D!!! You HAVE to see it in 3D, everything comes alive, you become a part of the surroundings. Most amazing movie I have seen to date."
"There's a lot of gushing going on for this film, and rightly so. After a Summer of lackluster crap, along comes this magnificent film. For once the hype was actually deserved. I won't talk about the plot, this film is best seen with as little information as possible. I will say that I wasn't prepared for the experience, even as a jaded film-goer I was transported and yes, moved. I didn't expect the emotional impact, but Cameron is a master at pushing all the right buttons, and he does so here masterfully.Some of the criticism lies in the ""surface"" quality of the plot, but again, Cameron has never made deep, cerebral films. Cameron is an entertainer, and thank God for it. This film is pure, futuristic, ahead of it's time escapism. I was absolutely floored."
"Watch everything in your life you'd have ever wanted to appreciate, before you watch the AVATAR , there won't be anything you could ever praise but AVATAR , once you'd seen it! There's no guessing game and not too much of the plotting, it was objective and smart with its clichés ,it keeps you glued and pays you many times more to you than you paid with every second.A complete lovable heartfelt connection of man with an alien, an instinct to survive and the way of life , a journey from the underdog to the leader , a journey from pandora to earth! I loved it for its beauty, i love it because it surpassed my imagination, this was my life's greatest spectacle after 80 days around the world!"
"Yes, the special effects were impressive - but they just went on too long. The first segment, where she was teaching him about Pandora, had some magnificent effects, but I really did not need 20 minutes to get the point. Then, the first ""war"" although horrible enough in its unreasonable ferocity of modern war power against the natives with only arrows and spears was followed up with another one, even more horrible, purely for the sake of the special effects. I was holding my ears and closing my eyes, the mass destruction of these wonderful people was all too close to the American destruction of the native American Indians, with all its destructiveness. There was no character development, the acting was so simplistic, the plot formulaic, the dialog trite and simple.I wanted to like this film, but was ready to leave about half way though - and if Cameron had held to a disciplined directing mode it would only have been half as long and a much better picture."
"At last the moment has come which i have been waiting for about an year now... The most anticipated movie in recent times is finally out. To express my view in one line - AVATAR will divide cinema as we knew it so far into a pre-AVATAR and post-AVATAR era. All those people who appreciate cinema as an art will enjoy this experience. Ya its not a movie.... its an experience. James Cameron has proved beyond doubt that he is not only the king of the world but ""God of cinema"". Because even god could not have created such a beautiful world. I mean screw Monalisa... This is real art. The attention to detail is unimaginable. Every tree, creature, landscape is so stunning and nothing like you have ever seen before.Plot revolves round Jake Sully, an ex-marine who has lost his legs being sent to Pandora, a distant world full of exotic flora and fauna and large deposits of ""Unobtainium"", a rare earth mineral worth millions. Pandora has a native population called Na'vi who love nature and hence pose a threat to mining operations. Hence remotely controlled half human and half na'vi bodies are grown called AVATARs to mix with local Na'vi and convince them to relocate. Jake in his AVATAR understands Na'vi culture and human imperialistic attitude which could destroy the whole Pandora. Hence Jake needs to make a choice which will decide future of pandora.For those people who argue that the plot and few sequences are not new have to understand that the story and major portion of screenplay was written by JC in 1994. The story is interesting enough to keep you glued to the screens for 2 hrs 45 mins ( which is not a problem... I could have sat there for 3 more hours as movie was so damn brilliant). The story is very relevant for the present age of global warming. It is in no way preachy but sends a strong message.On the technical side, this movie is a sure milestone in cinema history. 1890 - Strongman Sandow(First motion picture) 1895 - The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots(First movie with special effect) 1918 - Cupid Angling(First colour movie) 1927 - The Jazz Singer(First Talkie movie) 1973 - Westworld(First movie with CGI) 2009 - AVATAR(Need i say more)The motion capture is so realistic that it pushes CGI technology to its limit. I saw the movie with a friend who did not know anything about avatar and he could not realise the Na'vi were CGI and not actors with blue paint on them. It is so photo-realistic. Spielberg, Peter Jackson try to match this if you can !!! And people who say it looks a bit video gamish, need to stop looking trailers on their 14' screens and check it out on big screen. I have never seen CGI with so much real emotion in it. The climax battle scene is the mother of all war scenes... It will blow your mind.Performances are equally brilliant. Sam Worthington is definitely the next big thing in Hollywood. He is almost flawless as Jake. He is tough and has a charm to pull off the child like nature of the character. As in every JC movie, female lead gets the best part and importance. Zoe Saldana is awesome as Neytiri. Its truly her year with two mega blockbusters in Star trek and AVATAR. Sigourney ""The queen of sci-fi"" Weaver is outstanding as Grey, the head of avatar operation. When JC meets Sigourney, its nothing short of magic. But the surprise package for me is Stephen Lang as Col.Quatrich, the tough head of security. This guy steals the show.This has been an year of really crappy big budget movies like transformers 2, Terminator Salvation and GI Joe to name a few. But thank god at least one guy in Hollywood knows how to spend money. Of course the man who has raised the bar of movie making so high all through his career that only he can out do himself - James Cameron. This guy knows how to create hype and most importantly how to live up to the hype as he has proved it time and again in his career. This is truly a JC classic in the ranks of Terminator and Aliens. Not only its technologically years ahead of its time but movie is emotionally very strong... Like the speech given by Jake to all Na'vi inspiring them to fight, made me get goosebumps. 12 years wait and I say its worth it. The movie is already nominated for Golden Globe and will surely be a front runner at the Oscars.This movie is meant to be seen in IMAX 3D ( or at least 3D). Its an experience you will remember for long time. It may not make as much money as titanic due to slightly less wider target audience. Even though it is the most expensive movie ever made, i am sure it will recover its budget in 2 to 3 weeks. Sure shot blockbuster. But more importantly it is this generations STAR WARS. Mark my words, people will talk about this movie even after 30 years...10 on 10 from me...."
"I was beyond impressed, this movie was good in so many ways that it is hard to know where to start... So I guess it will be with the CG - These were by far the best effects I have seen in an movie, the integration of both live action and animation was seamless, I recommend it to be seen in 3D, because I caught myself swatting at what was 3D bugs flying around. The storyline was long but kept me involved so as not to become bored, and though I was warned it was kind of a ""Tree Hugger movie"" I did not get that, there was much more to the story than that, and should wake people up to how we should treat each other. My nest step is to see it again in IMAX-3D."
My review is going to be short and sweet. I got out of the theatre 30 minutes ago and Im still in a stupor about the movie I have just seen.This movie connects with the audience in a way that no other movie has. Near the middle and end of the movie I felt an emotional connection with the characters. That has NEVER happened to me with any movie I have ever seen. All I can say about this movie is that it is a must see and a must have. I know that as soon as it is released I will be buying a copy and watching it a couple times over.I know that my review was short but I hope it gets a couple more people to see the movie because it is worth the money.
"Stunning Visuals, movie making at its finest and a milestone for cinema history, Avatar is the first block of a new generation of movies. The world Cameron created, will dazzle you, leave you wondering about the amount of creativity, the attention to details, the flawless of mixing acting and graphics, in a truly wonderful, remarkable experience. Its a movie everyone in my family, Friends have enjoyed, the storyline is predictable, but still deep enough to engage you, the environmental and culture messages can not be ignored, and are vividly weaved into the story.The possibilities of movies that will be made after Avatar, is just astonishing, well done Mr.Cameron, you've deserved the headline."
"To be honest, I didn't really know what to expect of Avatar, thinking I'd get along to it sometime and not knowing much about it, but got pulled to the cinema by my kids. Well, I was absolutely blown away. My first words after it finished were: ""Great, fantastic and quite possibly the best sci-fi movie of all time."" It really is that good and that technically advanced that it raises the bar - not by increments but a whole lot.I might get to a more detailed review and Cameron's use of themes he's used in his past sci-fi like Aliens and The Abyss, his cipher characterisation, but that's just nit-picking detail. This is a complete tour-de-force and there's been nothing like it for its richness and complexity of detail. Go see it in the cinema for the 3D because I don't think the flat screen can do it justice. It's utterly, utterly amazing."
"James Cameron, herewith referred to as JC, has done it again.Oh, how I feared that Avatar would be a cringe-worthy snooze-fest but all the reservations have been unwarranted. JC has boasted that this movie would be a game-changer and I would say that on some levels this is definitely the case. The attention to detail of the visuals and the handling of the sound, which are all perfect on all counts, make this a movie experience beyond compare. The 3D does add a little to the experience but not as much as I expected.All in all you are submersed in a world beyond description, a love story which is a little corny but heart-felt, and an experience that makes you forget your worries and woes for a few hours. That is what going to the movies is all about. Needless to say, I loved it."
"The only thing this movie did for me was make me soooo bored I actually started remembering the plot of FernGully. Which I hadn't seen in like 18 years. I couldn't even remember its name. When I arrived home I furiously searched the internet for this mystery movie that I had forgotten and that Avatar somehow reminded me of.Then I found it and realized that it's exactly the same plot, except that it's a movie for children - which incidentally AVATAR also is, it's just that it cost 500$ billion, or whatever, to make so they had to pretend like it was for adults, but it really isn't. It's a kid's movie, and a 2 hours too long one at that.Frankly, what surprised me most about it was that it gets such good reviews... from almost everyone. I'm going to sit and wonder why for a while."
"A year after all the hype for this movie and I finally decide to write my review... but only after I watch it again on DVD.I have to admit, this movie is actually better in 2D. I could look at all the pretty things without staring at migraine-inducing blurry nothingness for three hours.I tried to suspend disbelief while I watched this movie. It didn't work the first time, and it didn't work this second time. I couldn't really enjoy this flick as I have that other terrible movie, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen. At least with that movie, one can sit there and enjoy the CGI without being too distracted by the lousy storyline.I face palmed often throughout my second viewing of this ridiculous, corny flick. Its story is beyond stupid, it is so insipid and so utterly lame it completely unraveled the great work WETA Digital did for this movie. It is totally impossible to sit there and enjoy WETA Digital's CGI effects without Mr Cameron's lousy, political environmental, anti American (LOL, isn't he a white American too) agenda slamming into your face over and over and over again.OK, Mr Cameron. I get that the Human Race are nothing more than hideous, evil orcs, trolls and goblins using advanced technology to kick the noble, beautiful, blue-skinned, cat-faced, 10 foot tall American Indians off their land so they can get the filthy rich Unobtainium all for themselves. Because, the evil corporation headed by that airhead white American CEO don't want to save the Earth with that stuff, oh no. They just want to shove it all in a bank vault and let this Unobtainium's value increase over a few decades give or take. This should send their corporation's shares through the roof, they'll be the richest evil humans in the history of human kind!!!This movie's portrayal of the American Military was idiotic, unbelievable and poorly presented and like the evil, vindictive, greedy, planet-raping American corporation, just as ridiculous and cliché riddled.Characters were horrible caricatures and acting was by-the-numbers cliché cardboard cutouts. Mr Worthington was especially poor and laughable, as was his co-star, that screaming, hissing, crying, over-emoting soapy, the giant blue cat-chick. Her performance was creepy, horrible and unbelievable. She knows this dude is a human, yet she still lays down and has sex with him? WTF? In the most awkward fail of a sex scene I've ever seen in a movie. So their sex is the same as ours? Their genitals are the same? They have human woman breasts, just on giant ten foot tall blue emaciated smurf bodies. They suck face the same too, just with vampire teeth and ""hair plugs"". Uggghk.The flying scenes weren't as good as the flying scenes in How to Train Your Dragon. Wall-e was better with its environmental message. Heck, even Princess Mononoke has a better story concerning Earth, Forest guardians, and protecting the environment. Plus, the characters from these movies have more personality and humility, which not a single character from Avatar has. I didn't even like Sigourney Weaver's character, and she's an awesome actress. I still don't get how a dumb, trigger-happy marine could suddenly go from crippled nobody to the Na'vi's version of Return of the King! That not even the scientists could achieve, and they'd been on that planet, what - five years? Rolls eyes. The worst aspect of this ""film"" was the battle scene at the end. The idiot marine-come-smurf decides the only answer to a conflict is to inflict genocidal murder and violence. Rolls eyes. You'd think a movie three hours long would see him change from trigger-happy gun-toting douche-bomb to someone understanding that violence is definitely NOT the answer. Nope. Now he's a red-bird riding, gun-toting, trigger-happy, arrow shooting war-smurf on the absolute, murderous, anti-human rampage. Rolls eyes.And to add insult to injury, he willingly offs himself (no conflict in sight here though!) so he can keep that nice piece of tail all to himself forever and ever.What a fairytail ending to a fairy tale masquerading as a ""science fiction epic"".BOO!!! Mr Cameron!!!1/10"
"I have been a regular on IMDb for many years. i did not however venture onto the Avatar discussion board before this was released and I am disturbed to see such insanity from both sides of the camp.People are destined to hate this, out of jealousy or some some misplaced sense of self-righteousness. People are also destined to love this movie, many of you here have been in love with the film for years strangely enough! Whether you are a hater or a fan, the only opinion that counts is from the guy who didn't sit in either camp, who didn't give a damn when he walked through those cinema doors! I have been a lover of movies for years. When I watched Gladiator at the age of 15 I was hooked on films. I rarely dislike a good movie and I always dislike a poor one. Avatar was given 261 minutes of my full attention, would the movie speak to me I wondered? Would I understand it's language? Or would I leave unimpressed?Avatar, as we speak, is about to smash pirates and Lord of the Rings from 2nd and 3rd place on the box Office podium. Cameron will occupy the top spot for another 13 years and in my opinion, Titanic will be displaced! Counting inflation, Avatar will turn out to be the biggest movie of all time!I have reserved some judgement aside, based on the fact this was my first 3D viewing since 3D became the new sliced bread. I liked the format during the trailers and I was impressed at how much it had come along in recent years. I had a basic knowledge of the Avatar plot, through the trailers and the odd article. Avatar is high end concept for the most demanding and critical movie going audience in history - it needed the execution of the most high end director. Within 20 minutes, Cameron seeks to immerse you in Pandora, in this strange world, in his dream! As a fan of historical epics, I was amazed at the sheer grandeur of Avatar, the scale and magnitude of it's environments is beyond compare - the 3D working overtime to blow you away.The story is great, very basic good vs bad with a hint of The Last Samurai but by know means repetitive or prosaic in any way. We understand how Jake can fall in love with his new surroundings and we realise the ulterior motives of the humans from the offset. Pandora is an incredible experience because it takes you places that your imagination rarely manages in a dream! An charged forest habitat, lighting up, speaking to the navi. The creatures at one with the natives. A paraplegic in pandora can stand, he can walk and run, and he can fly! The dragon-like creatures give us the most stunning aerial views of the planet as well as show case the power of 'The Hive' (Jackson's Weta computer sound stage responsible for the live cgi we see) and what it brings to our eyes. It beggars belief that this was not possible a decade ago and now a new door had been discovered, unlocked and fully opened.As Jake spends his days and nights learning the way of the Navi, so forms the love story. War does not come without love, or without a woman. Tried and tested formula, but not a dead one seeing as this love is between a human and Navi. The idea is brilliant and it becomes more dream-like as the story progresses - only when in the MRI scanner can Jake fly through the trees with Neytiri and forget about his mission. The viewer is left in pain because of the sheer unconventional means the two characters can interact and be with one another. The ending serves as a delight to those with more interest in the forming love story. however before we get to the end, we are subjected to the most stunning intergalactic battle committed to cinema in recent times, perhaps in all time. Never has the impossible looked more real!On a human level, the emotions run wild. On a visual scale, we are left breathless. And on a personal note, 10 years after being blown away by Gladiator, I remain in complete awe of what can be done when someone has a special idea and stands by it. Cameron will not repeat his success here, truly the stuff of dreams.I was sceptical when I went to see Ridley's masterpiece, which for the last 10 years has remained my favourite film, as I never though a film could speak to me in the manner it did. Now I have been captivated by Avatar, I got that feeling once more and I understand it's language. If Avatar is a failure, then it is a failure which towers above any other movies successes!"
"At first, I was rather skeptical of the movie, I heard Avatar and thought 'The Last Airbender'. Then I saw a trailer and became enamored with the movie. Then, when I went to see the film, it lived up to my expectations and them some. Granted, the plot is not the strongest feature of the movie, but it is there and it makes everything flow along nicely. The important characters get plenty of screen time and are all pretty likable, especially the main antagonist, Colonel Quartich. Okay, maybe likable isn't the right word, but he's cool. And extremely BA, because who would kick out an airlock to shoot at people? Or barely reacts to being on fire? Anyways, none of those people are the real star of the show. The world, Pandora steals that title. It's a rich, alien world that will be a feast for the eyes. The wildlife is familiar in concept, but completely alien. Also, one last thought. While the wildlife looks absolutely amazing, so does everything else in this movie. The machines, the Na'vi, the world, the people. All of it looks fantastic. And, shell out the extra money to see this in 3d, ignore the headache, and prepare to be amazed."
"*Possible Spoilers Ahead* Just came out of Avatar's Australian debut, certain cinemas decided to show an advanced screening in 3D (on 16/12/2009).What follows is a story & visual effects that are mind boggling. The story is a mix between previous Hollywood films, a cross between The Last Samurai & The Last of the Mohicans, among a few others. But the story is where the similarities end.Put simply, James Cameron, has & will always be a visionary for Hollywood along with anyone remotely connected to the science of making movies. ""Avatar"" will be used as a benchmark for future 3D films. 2D looks like a thing of the past.Sam ""Worthy"" Worthington deserves all the praise one can muster, his unquestionable work ethic and honesty will lead him to be one of the most successful actors of this generation. I do not tag Sam ""Worthy"" for nothing - without his dedication to the role of Jake Sully, this movie would have been grossly incomplete.The star of ""Avatar"" is BLU-JAKE (his alter ego - or what I shall refer to him - not surprisingly the so called ""AVATAR"" himself), however the character of Blu-Jake has been compared to having the morals & dilemmas of Captain Nathan Algren (T Cruise's character in ""The Last Samurai""). The dilemma over who & what is right or wrong, and using that as a benchmark to judge himself - What looked to me like a character struggling with inner conflict.The story revolves around humans wanting to take advantage of a mineral on the distant planet Pandora, although with disastrous results.As ""Jake Sully"" mentions in the trailer ""The Strong Prey on the Weak"" is the major theme of the film, and how the so-called ""weak"" choose to fight back with the help of nature.Possibly the best film in recent years. Cameron NEVER FAILS to deliver and we wait for AVATAR 2 & 3 with eager anticipation, let's not keep it another 12 years, Jimbo :D If the AMPAS fail to honor the film for Best Director & Best VFX at the 2010 Oscars, they may as well be shooting themselves in the foot, for credit ought to be given when it's due.I happily rate the film a full 10."
"Avatar is, as you will have seen from other reviews, probably the most visually stunning movie ever made. The scenes of the beauty of Pandora will knock you out! Watching the movie it was very easy to forget (and I did) that the characters were CGI creatures, so real were they implemented. The beauty of the film is contrasted with the gung ho American marines and the greed of the mining company trying to exploit the natural resources of Pandora, without in any way understanding its beauty or the close bond felt by the Pandorans to their environment and the other life on the planet.The plot of the film is excellent and the soundtrack superb, frequently making you jump with unexpected highly realistic sounds.The best film I have seen in a very long time, way up there with the Lord of the Rings, my previous favourite film (and story) of all time.I felt that the Director was trying to say something about man in this film, on the one hand able to be noble and capable of creating stunning beauty (just see the visuals in this film) and the contrasting violence, greed and stupidity that we can show. God knows what will happen if and when we do meet aliens, they will probably be shot to pieces before we can ever learn anything about them! In summary, don't hesitate to see this film, I defy you not to be enthralled in the stunning beauty of Pandora and the superb story."
"I have completely lost all hope in Hollywood. This movie was horrible. There was no originality in the plot or the characters whatsoever.Let's look at the movie in it's entirety. Original right? NO! The truth is, if you strip away all of the special effects and look at the plot you'll notice that it's the same plot used in so many other movies. I've summed the plot up into one sentence. This is the plot: It's Disney's Pocahontas substituting the American Indians with blue aliens. What is so special about that? James Cameron is overrated as a director. Everyone is calling him the greatest director of our time. I hope the people calling him that, aren't speaking for all of us. I'd like to see him direct something with some kind of meaning to it instead of blue aliens fighting humans over a tree. Steven Spielberg, in my opinion, is the greatest director of our time. I will say that the performances given by Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver were amazing! Everyone else was so-so.There was nothing special about this movie. I literally feel like I wasted two and half hours of my life and thirteen dollars of my hard earned money to see this piece of crap.I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy."
"I cannot believe the praise this film has been getting! Sure it looks pretty, but, will that really hold the test of time? Video games will look this good in a few years. How did James Cameron's depiction of aliens degrade so much since the 80's? If you're gonna spend this much money to make a movie hire someone to write a non-laughable and at least reasonably original script? Or why bother, because plenty of people seemed to eat it up...Unobtainium? really? You couldn't think of a made up name for your space metal that you had to call it unobtainium? Whats worst of all, I have to wake up each day and come to terms that I live in a world where complete and utter crap like this is passed off as a good movie."
"We've been waiting a long time for this to turn up on the big screen... well, here it is, AVATAR, the new blockbuster by James Cameron, having devoured some 300 million dollars... was it worth it?The Marine veteran Jack Sully, now handicapped, joins a research group on a moon called Pandora. These researchers employ so-called 'Avatars,' genetic reproductions of the Pandora natives, to win the natives' trust. These natives, the Navi, are physically superior beings, blue in color, and catlike in their motions; humans can connect with these clones and control them as if they were their own bodies. Reason for this whole endeavor is, of course, some rare resource that is beneath the natives' tribal home. Having learned to control his Avatar, Sully soon infiltrates the tribe - yet has to struggle with his conscience as he falls in love with a Navi huntress and the Navi highly complex traditions. In order to protect the natives, Scully will have to betray his own race...Admittedly, Cameron's plot isn't very original: it sounds like a Western at first, where Native Americans fight to protect their lands against the imperialistic settlers, pushing the Frontier westwards. Also, you could easily employ the movie's plot onto the colonial times, where colonists exploited the native tribes of Africa, depriving them of their resources, leaving only barren wasteland behind.The idea of the Avatar, however, is something that has never before been used so perfect: whereas it naturally offers a lot of potential conflicts and other problematic issues, the tension is rising with every passing minute - will the humans in charge just pull the plug? And although there are scenes which have been on the screen before, it never tires you.Not a single boring moment in 166 minutes - that's a new record, I reckon. There are no lengths whatsoever - every grand landscape shot is exactly where it is supposed to be, and the movie never attempts to substitute some intrinsic deficit with its excellent computer animations. The CGI is indeed revolutionary; and it is used to compose the movie's essence. Trust me, you have never seen anything like it before. James Cameron has created a fantastic world second to none - he has created a whole new exciting, thrilling universe that you won't want to leave once you've been sucked into it. After the 166 minutes I wouldn't have bothered to watch another two hours.Let's make this quick: if you are a fan of sci-fi and fantasy flicks, you are COMPELLED to watch this! Several times!Cameron's Avatar is by far one of the best sci-fi/fantasy movies in years; even the late Star Trek cannot compete with this one... it is just so compelling, so forceful in its aesthetics and tone... it is THE perfect sci-fi/fantasy movie! It was worth to wait this long! Ultimately, I can't think of any other director who could've developed such a visual masterpiece from a mere vision from 15 years ago."
"I want to say for one, that this movie was EXTRAORDINARY! And for what it's worth comes everything you can't possible imagine of what Cameron had in store for the audience. It was mesmerizing to see that the 3-D lived up to its hype and and wowed everybody in my theater. Like only 2 people used the bathroom within a 2 and half hour period!? That is the mark it left with audiences when it first appeared on screen. Nobody knew what to expect, and in the following, everyone got what they didn't expect which was lush colorful movie with some great CGI that was perfectly complimented with a great story... Some will beg to differ, but the real star is the 3-D. Yes, the 3-D! Wow, It has as of today changed the way will see our entertainment and how we view it. So ladies and guys I would prefer everyone to see this cause it is only worth the time on the big screen while still in 3-D format. 20/10.."
"I actually feel like I've just seen the most beautiful painting ever painted, allowed entry into it and that I've stayed there for 2 and a half hours. I feel like I became part of this world and now, at home, I kind of miss the scenery, the animals, the people and the nature of the planet.This movie is more groundbreaking than Jurassic Park, Star Wars and all the other historical movies that you've read about. Though the story and the plot is not very original, like a mixture of Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas and, well, The Matrix, it doesn't really matter. The movie is not about changing your perspective on anything, imprinting some morals or shaking your beliefs, it's just about entertainment.Thank you James Cameron. I actually am one of the few who didn't like Titanic, I thought it was too mushy and story-lacking... but this, man, this is something else. I won't be able to watch another movie for weeks because, why bother?"
I only have four words to say reallyOH MY F**ING GOD!oh and the 3d is just the final touch to complement the experience just as a beautiful and sexy lingerie complements a divine body...HOLY MOTHER OF MOSES! AND ALL THE BIBLICAL CHARACTERS AND DEITIES EVER IMPROVISED BY HUMANS!Don't expect to read any plot summaries here. That would be pointless. This is a classical story taken a step further. Just stop reading silly reviews and go watch it fool!P.S. Apparently there is a longer version waiting to be released on Blu-ray. I can't wait...
"Avatar is truly a one of a kind movie, one that everyone should see. If you have an IMAX 3D theater near you, see it in 3D. The effects are astounding. You are really able to enjoy James Cameron's vision. After the movie I almost felt like I had visited an alien planet and returned back from it. Incredible visuals. The Na'vi people are beautiful and fascinating. They have amazingly expressive faces and eyes.I think that the best thing about this movie is that it forces us to look at ourselves as a race. What kinds of behaviors and personalities do we reward and condone. A lot of people are saying that the characters are very simple and archetypal. We have the hardened war colonel, the greedy corporate suit, the anti-military scientist, etc. In my opinion the characters are made this way for a reason. Every character is the prototype of what is expected of them. In the US and many other countries on Earth we consider the perfect military colonel as being loyal without limits, able to shut off their feeling and emotions and get the job done. Basically to have no real sense of morality besides that of getting their country what they need and want. Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is everything a person would be if he were able to fully become our societal archetype of a perfect military commander. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) is everything that makes up the successful businessman prototype, greedy without thought to anything else. Totally goal oriented. These two have become exactly what their society wanted them to be, and when they did they became monsters.One the other hand we have Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and co. Scientists who sympathize with the Na'vi and are against use of military action on Pandora and towards the Na'vi. However they are unable to really do anything useful to help the natives, especially since their whole operation is funded by Selfridge and whatever corporation he works for. Their promises and actions ring hollow.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is the blank slate of the movie, he is like a child. He gets to see the extremes that have become of the humans and offset that with the way the Na'vi are. Under the guidance of Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) he learns the ways of the native people of Pandora. The Na'vi kill and fight, yet they do so only for a purpose and usually with sadness. They have warriors and spiritual leaders and look at their environment and nature as their mother and constant companion. They are in touch with everything around them to an unthinkable degree. This movie is really all about him choosing which way of life he thinks is worth fighting for. And of course the fight that comes after that decision.This is one of those movies that comes along once in while. It's unforgettable and though the dialog might need a little work, Avatar delivers solid entertainment. Well worth the money to see it in a theater."
"This movie has no equal.. Incredible effects, totally mind blowing environment. I just did not want the movie to end.I read some comments saying it has so and so, and that is why they give 8 or 7 for rating. Movies are to entertain and this movie is by far the BEST entertainment i got. Dear James Cameron, why did you make the movie so short?? Even if it was almost three hours it was not enough for me. I need Avatar 2. Start making it please !!!!!!!!!!! And make it a little longer ........Hey you people who are reading this, why are you waiting for ?? Go to a 3D theater and watch this. You will not regret it."
"Normally i wouldn't even bother vote/comment movies. But this movies change that...I went on a date with my wife, we eat at a fine restaurant, good food, and then we went to the cinema.... We picked this movie - Avatar - we haven't heard of it before and we didn't event knew that it was the premiere evening in Denmark. It was an extreme movie experience. a more beautiful and glorious movie cant be found. It is the most intensive experience we both ever had with a movie, i can surely recommend it to everyone. And I'm hoping to see/read more about that world again. The story is good and trustworthy, and we did believe it all the way.Thanks a lot to the makers of this beautiful movie!"
"Mr. Cameron as much as I appreciate the amazing special effects and gorgeous animation as well as the detail you put into creating a new world with species, I can't help but think I have seen this exact same movie before. I must say I am also a big fan of Ferngully just like you (assumed lol), but you should really consider on coming up with your own original story, granted it was a great concept. Besides making this movie is probably just an excuse to throw other people under the bus (military.) I mean ptsh, it's not like they are putting their lives on the line defending our country or anything, right? Way to go on making a film with so much potential turn political. Maybe a sequel should help, let's make them fly and have the ability to surf! As a matter of fact, you should title it ""Large Flying Surfing Smurfs Protectors of Mystic Fairy Land and Star Wars Creatures Part Two!"" Phew, sorry about that, I am getting off topic, in all honesty this movie kind of sucked. And just out of the goodness of my heart you earn a golden star, hats off to you sir."
"For the longest time, I have been saying that cinema is seriously going down hill, that they will produce any pathetic crap because they know people will pay for it. And I would like to thank the creators of Avatar for proving my point.Sure the CGI effects were pretty good. They were shiny and the trees glowed when the big blue people walked on them. And a group of people who do not even breathe oxygen have remarkably human characteristics, save for the fact that they are blue. I have seen really good special effects in movies, this wasn't one of them. What made these special effects great was how many they used.I was falling asleep throughout this entire film, begging it to finally come to an end so my mother would turn it off. The plot was boring, the character development was non-existent. The only thing that made the movie worth watching was the effects and half way through the story I found myself craving the real characters.Probably the worst part of the film, in my opinion, was the final battle. Now I am fully aware of the idea of suspension of belief but this was just completely ridiculous. You know why indigenous people were always wiped out? Because the invaders had more advanced weaponry. The People are using bows and arrows and spears, and flying around on pretty birds, why the humans have big planes and bombs and guns, and you expect me to believe they could really possibly lose? Seriously? I saw nothing in this movie that earned it the praise that it got. In the moments that I should have been on the edge of my seat, I found myself rolling my eyes. When characters were killed and I should have been sad, or surprised, I shrugged.I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion, if you liked this film, good for you. In my opinion, this movie was one big liberal environmentalist add that was shoved down your throat until you choked. And a completely amateurish add at that."
"It's interesting and it's exotic, and so imaginatively rendered! Indeed, a cinematic thrill-ride! The film's CGI effects deliver a natural and unspoiled world to compare with a world of machines, and its digital characters are gorgeously stunning to behold! And the film does seem like one amazing futuristic action-battle razzmatazz, directed with the most uncanny computer-generated 3-D technological feat, James Cameron's epic film is, in fact, an eco-minded epic, gastulated with the most humanly issues, universally familiar ever since the colonial times. Indeed, the film's rich themes are immensely dark! Indeed, its story injects themes of colonization, imperialism, militarism, cultural differences and cross-cultural communication, and genetic engineering...all of which any misstep taken could be disastrous to peace, nature and humanity. Needless to say, this film does again echo Cameron's trademark film themes of corporate greed and the love-hate relationships with technology. Indeed, like the love between Jack and Rose in Titanic,' this love between the movie's Jake and Nevtiri, is solid that could only wither when 'death doth them part.' And in war, there will always be those who'd be willing to fight as long as it's a just war, as exemplified by Michelle Rodriquez' Trudy. James Cameron's film captures two worlds... Earth that is highly and technologically advanced and which we are familiar, and the other, a seemingly 'primitive' and physically-fit civilization of the Pandora planet, in which terrain and life remains little altered since God's generous Creation! The year is 2154, the year when modern and advanced technology has given way to the moist exclusive and unique weaponry and robotic achievements for war and science does allow avatars to be created for one human race to look like another. Wouldn't anyone be as flattered as Sam Worthington's Jake Sully to be selected to be as part of the exploration team of the exotic Na'vi world, especially when it's headed by the brilliant botanist, Sigourney Weaver' Grace. After all, their mission is for the good of human curiosity, scientific research, and knowledge! After all, Jake does understand that his twin brother had died while on the same mission, and that, he has the same genetic match of his brother to easily replace him without posing any unsuspecting lab complication. As we follow the wheel-chair bound Marine veteran in his avatar status into the Pandora planet, what is captured is so amazingly dreamlike. It's a world filled with mysticism, and in which nature thrives in absolute pure beauty and in abundance, with blue-skinned, golden-eyed, and very tall and slender beings functioning with and around nature, and complying with nature's forces... sans technology; sans machines. Indeed, an absolute contrast to Jake's own harsh world of man-created machines and scientific labs! Though the presence of Grace serves to remind Jake of his mission, it is in Pandora that Jake finds his rebirth of life.... his ability to walk and fly without constraints, a refreshingly new way to live, and he is also falling in love. And Jake does enter a world in which unimaginable creatures, like viperwolves, thanators, and banshees,roam! Oh, I do love the scenes in which Zoe Saldana's Neytiri, under the order of her mother, the Na'vi shaman Moat, teaches Jake the survival tactics of the Omaticaya people. My favorite moments are when Jake tries to control and bond with a banshee, and later, with the Direhorse! But when Jake discovers the real reasons for the interests of Center's Administrator (Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge) and Stephen Lang's Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) in the Pandora planet, will he continue his mission? The Pandora planet has a rich natural resource, a rare and valuable mineral called unobtanium, deposited beneath a Hometree. Will Jake continue his scouting for Colonel Quaritch's soldiers and lead them to the mineral deposits? And will Grace and all her team members, including Jake, support the exploitations of Pandora's inhabitants? Will Jake betray his Earth people and can he be able to win Neytiri and the Na'vi people's trust? What if he goes against Selfridge and Colonel Quaritch? After all, these evil and greedy two have access to the lab that controls his avatar! What follows is our observance of the character dealing with their conscience, as Pandora continues to face attacks and destruction, both from ground and from air, as nature and people are blown to bits! The amazing CGI effects make the battle - between Earth's military-industrial forces and the oppressed, arrow-bearing inhabitants of the Pandora planet - very engaging. And Director Cameron does take his story to its climax, ultimately reminding us that nature is not a force to be reckoned. And ultimately, this film is about 'good' winning over 'evil.' Every character, human or digital, is interesting to follow, providing his or her conscience to his/her role in delivering the film's themes, And overall, the film is spectacularly mesmerizing and very enjoyable!"
"I went with my two kids, one is 16 years old and my daughter 9 years old. Afterwards by the buss stop, we looked at each other, and in unison we knew and agreed, we had experienced something extraordinary at many different levels, an once in a lifetime moment. This is truly by far the movies of all movies. The only bad thing that I can say about this movie is I never wanted it to end, all from the jaw dropping scenery to the emotional computer graphics. I takes a hold of you as I never experienced it in the theaters before.I feel blessed and grateful, really honored by the makers of Avatar, for letting us share this beautiful adventure, it is truly a milestone in motion picture history !"
"I went to this movie when it was out in theaters after hearing how ""amazing"" and ""compelling"" it allegedly was. Normally I like any movie, but 20 minutes in I felt my back side starting to fall asleep. This only happens when my ... is trying to worn me to get out of the theater as fast as possible. I kept wishing that this movie would turn out to be good, but then I soon realized how predictable it really was. I figured out what would happen within the first hour. I couldn't even sit through this movie again even if I was getting paid to do it. Blue cat people? Really? They connect to things with their hair? What kind of stuff was this director smoking and how do I get it, because this was pure crap wrapped up in some pretty wrapping paper with a nice bow that smelled like bile. How come, half way through we hear nothing of this rare rock crap that the government is hunting for? They discard a lot of things in this movie pretty quick and then it becomes some dramatic romance between some crippled guy and a blue cat lady. I still wish I could get my money back and I didn't pay to get into this movie. Thanks a lot Avatar for killing some of my brain cells and stealing precious hours of my life that I will never get back. Don't watch this. Don't even rent it. Don't even look up pictures of it on the internet. I swear, your IQ will drop."
"Confused already? No? Well apparently millions of people weren't either,when they declared this to be one of the best movies they've seen in their lives,and then presumably bought a second and third and fourth cinema ticket to see this.I am not one of those people.I was confused.And amused.And pardon me for saying this,but I had to wake up the latent retard in me to be able to enjoy riding flying dragons,some unidentified horse-like hippo,a Jurassic something and a whole world apparently perfect. Well,that bothers me.Nothing is perfect.Even when you're high,you know that you're going to have a hang-over.Those Navi's were so perfect that it made me suspicious.The movie doesn't show this,but i bet they were into something really nasty,like attacking other tribes and raping all the women.And I bet they had their way with those flying dragons.Yes,I'm talking zoophilia with a dragon.Nevermind connecting neuron pony tales,how about connecting some penis and dragon pussy.Disgusted already? Now you know how I felt when watching Avatar.Oh yes,the CGI was ground-breaking.Let's hope next time Cameron just employs hundreds of Indian and Chinese computer programmers to give us Avatar 2, no actors,no common sense,no plot,just a diluted message and just computer generated Navis being perfect in their perfect world."
"I saw the trailer for avatar several times before I saw the actual movie. The trailer gave me the impression that the movie would be about the typical Humans: Good guys, Aliens: Bad guys hindering good guys. Therefore the full movie blew my mind. How Jake actually becomes one of them was unpredicted. Although what did disappoint me was that the natives did not accept Jake after the destruction of their home tree, but I later realized it was an important event to unfolding the plot. The $400 Million was put to good use I must say. The 3D effects and CGI was mind blowing. I was not surprised that James Cameron would produce such an amazing film. The trailer's effect of falsely convincing viewers that they understand the plot was ingenious. I was definitely surprised on how the plot unfolded. I've seen the movie twice and can't wait for the third. Just one recommendation; See it at the IMAX. The 3D experience is incredible. I usually don't get pop-corn at movies, I just buy a large drink and have to go to the bathroom in the middle. Lets just say I almost peed my pants because I could not leave that screen. Avatar: 10/10"
"First off, this was more than just a movie. ""Avatar"" will be known as the event that changed how we experience films from now on. Yeah, the 3D was amazing but the action, vivid colors, mind-blowing scenery, and sheer sense of reality was overwhelming. I easily rate this movie a 10, one I hope to watch soon in Imax 3D. Now comes the interesting part. While I watched the movie I had an odd sense of deja vue, like I'd seen this plot before. On the way out of the theater I asked my girlfriend how she liked it. She said it reminded her of ""Ferngully"". For those of you not familiar with that film, it was a cute, animated good vs. evil kinda movie from the early 80's where this human guy shrinks to the size of a fairy and meets up in this forest where all these other little folk live and whose environment is threatened by an evil, possessed logging machine. And there's many other parallels. I'm wondering how much of ""Avatar"" was really imagined by Mr. Cameron and how much may have been influenced by this kid flick from almost 30 years ago. So if you have a lazy afternoon, get ahold a copy of ""Ferngully"" and THEN go see ""Avatar"". The similarities will make you laugh."
"James Cameron's Avatar is basically the best movie I have ever seen, and now every other movie doesn't even come close as being as good. The setting of the movie takes place on Pandora, a lush, green planet filled with mystical creatures including the humanoids called the Na'vi. This place is so beautiful and magical to watch, especially at night where all plants and even the ground light up majestically. A little while into the movie I could tell what was going to happen but there are enough little twists to keep it exciting and not make it feel cliché. I found myself falling in love with the characters and the Na'vi people. I have been twice to this movie in 3D and I could go 5 more times. All in all, I don't really need to say much in this review and I don't feel I need to convince anyone to go see this movie, just go see it, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
"Film very good, interesting and impressionable - 10/10! Today descended on it in a cinema, an excellent film, and it is a bit sad. Editing to me also has very much impressed, as is very qualitatively made. It would be desirable even to present, how many all founders of this picture have laid the forces, works, abilities, and the time to receive here such wonderful film. The film went about 2.5 hours, and it to me has even more surprised. It is said that the film is even better if than it to look in 3D a cinema, but me and so it was pleasant, though to everyone the taste on viewing. I was not too lazy to estimate at all a film on IMDb. Soo a film I advise all to look, as the film to concern the category ' Must have '!"
"Most people have heard about this movie, and how it's got groundbreaking cinematics and will ""change the way movies are made and watched."" I'm not sure about all that, but I sure liked it.Please don't be fooled into thinking this is an action movie. There are a couple ""chase"" scenes, and one major ""fight"" scene. The rest of it is breath-taking CGI and plot development.Yes, there are several heavy-handed messages about imperialism, capitalism, pollution/destruction of the natural environment, and even a religious message or two. But these are secondary to the main story, which is a love story. If you are willing to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in the story, it is a magical experience. I NEVER see movies multiple times in the theater; I've seen Avatar twice, and WILL be purchasing the DVD."
It was really very wonderful & fascinating.............
"For a few months I put off watching Avatar because I felt that the trailer simply didn't grab my attention. From my notion of not judging a book by its cover just because the director is a celebrated writer, I shrugged this film off believing the general idea of the film to be either altogether ludicrous or heroically ambitious. After reading numerous reviews, hearing how good it was by word of mouth, and then learning it was fairly high up on the IMDb top 250, I decided to finally watch it. To put it bluntly I was blown away.I've watched this movie twice. The first time I watched it, I found the first 20-30 minutes to be fairly mediocre, with merely satisfactory character and plot development, however finding that the rest of the movie escalated into a very captivating and enjoyable experience. At the end of the first sitting I thought it was pretty good, but had one or two areas for improvement. After watching it a second time I was largely surprised to find that it simply blew me away as I enjoyed it from the opening sequence, whether this was due to my prior knowledge of what was to come, or simply paying more attention.The depth of the story is phenomenal, and really kicks into high gear when you start to learn more about the native humanoid clans known as the ""Na'vi"". Pandora, the world that James Cameron has created is incredibly detailed from the large landscapes to the small wildlife as you explore it through the eyes of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-Marine who came to Pandora following his genetically-identical twin brother's death. As the story progresses his performance gets better and better. Possibly the best display of acting comes from Zoe Saldana, portraying Neytiri, the Na'vi princess of the Omaticaya Clan who brings an electrifying personality to the story. As Jake is taught the way of the Na'vi people by Neytiri, they begin to fall in love in a groundbreaking and emotionally engaging experience as eventually they must fight to protect Pandora from the increasingly destructive and seemingly evil Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who does an excellent job in turning the audience as he becomes ever-more brutal towards the natives. Sigourney Weaver and Joel Moore also pull off their roles as Pandora scientists with perfection in their quest to learn more about the Na'vi as well as eventually helping Jake fight Colonel Quaritch.The special effects of Avatar, though clearly an unrivalled benchmark in the film industry, have been criticised by other reviewers who believe the film wouldn't be nearly as good were it not for the CGI. My opinion is quite the reverse. Though others may see the special effects as a 'distraction' from a poorly written story derived from other films, I believe the effects are precisely what make the story so effective. I strongly disagree with the notion that Avatar is like Dances With Wolves in some fancy clothes. I think the CGI, though brilliant in itself, is what draws you into this epic adventure as you really connect with the characters and cannot help but get wrapped up in the building tension between the Na'vi and human forces.On a final note, I think Writer/Director James Cameron hit the nail on the head when he created Avatar, which definitely deserves a spot in the top 100. One of those rare must-see films. 9.7/10"
"Avatar - Avatar is James Cameron's much awaited epic - the likes of which has not been seen in several years. It's great to know that something this long in the making was actually worth the wait. Jake (Sam Worthington) is a marine sent to replace his twin brother in a mission on an enemy planet. Jake is uploaded into an ""Avatar"", a genetic copy of the Na'vi the alien race he is to infiltrate. Jake's loyalties are put to the test.Avatar reinforces why certain ideas, now scathingly called cliché in the first place, are still so potent in the collective unconsciousness. The problem with so many films that tried and failed to utilize similar themes, is they have lacked the emotional maturity and depth of Avatar. The mere fact that Avatar succeeds so well indicates the truth of it's message. Is Jake going to convert? Of course he is. A relatable realistic portrayal of Jake by Sam Worthington makes us believe this. Who wouldn't want to fly? Who wouldn't want to see so much simple natural beauty and trade it in a heartbeat for their mechanized, false environment? One of the things I liked with that Jake's defection was not just for the sake of his co-star Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), who is played with vitality and heart.There is great work form the ensemble. Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore all give quality work as the good guys. Stephen Lang plays the badass villain Colonel Miles Quaritch, while Giovanni Ribisi plays a scummy corporate shill.The aesthetics and scope of the film are incredible. Whether it is seen in 3-D or not the film is a work of art. The planet is gorgeous from head to toe. Its destruction is a painful reminder of the Amazon Rainforest. Some of the creatures resemble underwater creatures, whilst others bear resemblance to the conquered by nature dinosaurs. The Na'vi are a subtle mix of various conquered peoples through history. Part Indian in bone structure, part African. And who took these people by storm in the first place you ask? It is a look into the other side's shoes that Avatar provides. We haven't been the good guys for a long time guys. I love my troops for their sacrifices, but I feel that these are very much the wrong wars.The film succeeds at being preachy by diving in with it's heart on it's sleeve. The message isn't tacked on: We are the assholes when we go forth with our worst instincts for cruelty and greed. The message is strengthened by a millenia of history. The film jogs it's viewers over to the side of peace and naturalism and has them rejecting corporate greed and military strong-arming in the course of three hours. If that's not a testament to the amazing power of correctly done film than I'm not sure what is.My tiny problem is the choice of the name for the precious metal the Earthers desire so badly: unobtainium. Yeesh. C'mon guys. How about a little subtlety for audience members over the age of 12? How about ""nofindium"" or ""macguffium"". In such a well crafted film, this feels like a first draft problem everyone was too deeply involved on the project to feel like changing.Several sites indicate that two sequels are in the works. My initial response was a groan, as I thought this was a great stand-alone film that needed no further examination, but this is James Cameron the master of sequels we're talking about here. I'm sure this will bear amazing children for the years to come.2009 was a sorry year in many respects, but film was not one of them. Virtually all of the films I deeply enjoyed for using their brains, brawn and wit were financial successes. Perhaps the mass appetite/recognition for quality has not been diminished, only starved in the past few years. Maybe there is hope after all. If we're going to survive, we'll need intelligence, artistry, and ecological conscientiousness, whether we like it or not.Avatar gets an A."
"While watching Avatar for the first time, all I could think was, ""Wow."" Ever since I left, all I could think was, ""I want to see it again."" I actually did see it again. Yeah, I loved Avatar.To start, James Cameron's epic was visually amazing. The Na'vi looked real. Pandora looked stunning. The creatures were convincing. The human weapons, ships, robots were also realistic and believable. But enough about the CG and special effects, what about the story? Many action movies and sci-fi movies don't have much of a plot. Avatar does not fall in this category. Cameron layers this story, intertwining numerous different themes.The first evident theme is shown by Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Quaritch is hardcore, hardened military man. He shows no mercy to his enemies and is quick to decide you are his enemy. He had an unwavering prejudice of the Na'vi and those who side with them. He is eager to fight them. The underlining theme here is that some like Quaritch fight first, ask questions later. Military is shown in a negative light in this film, but it really isn't military, they are hired ""security"". This brings me to the next theme woven into this film.The next theme is that of corporate greed. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) is trying to please shareholders by destroying the home of the Na'vi to get the conveniently named unobtainium. He needs to make money at all costs. We see this around us every day. Greed. Love of money above the lives of others. It is sad, but true.Another theme I've noticed is that of love. Jake falls in love with Neytiri. Cameron is good at telling stories like these (Titanic). Just to be clear, though, this is NOT the main theme. Sure it is there, but it does not consume the story.I've only touched on those themes that are evident to me and more obvious. I'm sure there are many more--I just thought of one: redemption--but I just wanted to convey that this film is much more than pretty visuals and action. There is a heart and soul to this movie.There was solid acting all around. They aren't the biggest names in the film industry, but the actors in this film do their job. The musical score in this film is good, not great. James Horner's score in some places is spectacular and in others somewhat generic. I've listened to it separate outside the movie (and obviously during the film) and I like it. It doesn't match his work in Titanic, but it does the job well. On a side note, this movie doesn't feature unnecessary sex scenes, swearing, or any other garbage featured in a lot of today's movies; I was pleasantly surprised.Finally, the 3D is cool, but not needed. I think in someways it really adds, but really, the film doesn't need 3D to be a great film.P.S. Cameron said if Avatar is successful, he might make up to 2 sequels to it.I expected to enjoy this movie, but not this much. I'm not going to give any more away. I was truly drawn into the Avatar experience. I think you can be too.http://jimmyssweetblog.blogspot.com/"
"I went into the theater not knowing what to expect on this one. I didn't have high expectations in the slightest. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG! This movie took number 1 on my movie list by leaps and bounds. From the plot, character development, CGI effects, everything! This movie is legit and I would gladly go see it again if opportunity arose! The best part i think was the character development and the high amount of emotion in this film. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but i definitely suggest to go see this movie--now. The language isn't perfect, but it's cleaner than most movies nowadays and it flows into the movie very nicely and is kind-of a must have in the areas it is placed. Definitely 10 stars and more if I could give them. Props on this one! Fantastic movie!"
"I've just returned from this amazing cinematic experience, and agree with all the raves about the technical expertise and effects that make this film stunning, the music which truly makes the spirit soar, and the amazing acting, from every single actor stretching their limits. But the clear messages that were being presented and sometimes bombarded at the audience were what really blew me away. As I sat and allowed myself to be entrenched in this fantasy world, it was as if I was hearing the voices and cries of thousands of generations of peoples and thousands more of animal and plant species that have been wiped off the face of the earth. ""We will fight terror with terror!"" the character of Stephen Lang shouts before attacking the natives, in a blatantly satirical ""kill all the hostiles - ie women, children, and people generally defending their homes"" scene. What a genius way of summing up the untold violence and stupidity of Western war mongers. It makes sense that Cameron is Canadian born. (says a fellow Canadian!)Any film which can convey such commendable messages without being didactic and be so utterly entertaining and visually beautiful deserves my ten."
"I have registered only because this AMAZING movie and even my poor English I have decided to write short review.I expected something special but what I saw in the cinema completely sucked me up there...with wonderful feelings and tears in my eyes. Performance, story, acting and music...all fit perfectly. We can not even name it a movie...it is more than it...Mr.Cameron made the dreams come true...I have been in the world I always wanted to be in and I want to come back... And that is why I go to see it again..and again.. Absolutely extraordinary!!!!"
"This movie is without a single doubt the best movie I've seen in a long time, and that even with stiff competition from a whole array of big movies that went up this year. Everything was so wonderfully made that it almost felt as if it could be a real world. He really brought to focus the best and the worst of man. He tries to show us that we need to be more tolerant, patient, curious and kind. And that we need to look after one and other and the environment which surrounds us. There is no plan B. This is a movie experience that will follow me for a long time I think, and the message that Cameron gives us is more important now than ever before."
"I have seen the movie in 3D last night and I am really really exited. This movie was fun to watch and I enjoyed nearly every minute (161 min). The storyline is not as bad as some people say. The visual effects are ground breaking and you will flow with the 3D effects, the colors, the atmosphere. When I left the theater, I was unable to put my opinion in words, it was just awesome. The last time I was blown away by a movie like this was 1999 with ""The matrix"". Just convince yourself and ignore the complaining critics. Watch it in 3D, otherwise you will miss a lot. In the times of huge flat screen TV's, cinema is back with an experience you can not copy at home. THIS is the right answer to illegal copies. The storyline is simple, but it works great. Just do not expect a deep philosophical statement and enjoy the experience. Definitely 10 out of 10. The best movie 2009 and a lot of entertainment."
"Ferngully in 3D. Wow. Seriously? How can you have this completely lame story with these pretty cool 3D effects and win awards? Hey, baby - it's Hollywood. I am not even sure there's much more to say - even the effects were not as spectacular as some folk made it seem. The blue folk seemed pretty bizarre on their own, but later in the movie when they showed them next to their human counterparts, we can see that while the 3D is much improved, the graphics have not evolved one whit farther than Jar-jar Binks. I mean, honestly - as long as you twits keep forking out dollars James T Cameron Diaz is gonna make another version.And you'll eat it with forks. Me? I say, ""fork this!"""
"Avatar reportedly cost a staggering 230 to 310 million dollars if you are prepared to believe what Wikipedia claims. Me, I can't help thinking I'd rather have had either Terminator 5 or Aliens 7 or, given the budget, both.Go and see Avatar for the visual spectacle – and believe me when I say that describing the visuals as spectacular is an understatement. Pandora is beautifully conceived and rendered, though obviously by people who have never been in a forest in their lives given the lack of dead trees, dead leaves, mud and general detritus. The plants, animals and people are convincing and beautiful.The critics have been going on about this being a breakthrough in film-making technology but I can't see it. It looks good but doesn't look better than, say, Lord of the Rings. The wholly animated alien people, plants and animals are no more impressive than the CGI Gollum was a few years ago. I actually felt rather disappointed, I was expecting something new but this is more of the same computer jiggery-pokery.Do not go and see it for the plot and writing. The plot is a monumentally formulaic ""don't hurt the environment, man"" riff. We have seen all the characters before in a hundred other films: the driven research scientist who's brilliance allows her to be rude to everyone; the greedy corporate schill prepared to do anything to ensure a profit; the battle hardened colonel with an itchy trigger finger; etcetera ad infinitum. The dialogue, while not awful, is dull and unmemorable, lacking any humour or wit.Go and see it, the critics like it, most people like it, you'll probably like it. I thought it was okay with a side order of gigantically missed opportunity.Spoiler Giant corporation, ""The Company"" (Weyland-Yutani perhaps), plans to strip-mine the Eden-like planet/moon Pandora*. All that stands in their way are a race of technologically primitive aboriginals, the Na'vi (who suffer from what literary grammatologists call the ""Fantasy apostrophe"").Jake Sully, a paraplegic former marine, is recruited by The Company to operate the titular alien clone ""avatar"" originally made for his deceased twin brother. Sigourney Weaver's driven botanist/anthropologist wants him to help her study the aliens and their environment. Colonel Doombringer wants him to deliver intelligence on the aliens so that he can destroy them and Mr Corporate McEvil (Giovani Ribisi) wants him to persuade the Na'vi to leave their giant tree house so that he can drill for the precious unobtainum beneath it**.Jake, however, quickly becomes enamoured by the culture and ways of the Na'vi and his teacher, a stunningly gorgeous Na'vi called Neytiri (voice and, I assume, movements of Zoe Saldana). Coming to value the environmental harmony in which the Na'vi live, Jake leads them in a final battle to try to reclaim their world from the humans***.End Spoiler Expect a director's cut a few years after the DVD comes out where the voice-over has been removed and a bunch of unnecessary scenes added back in.* Who names a planet Pandora, for God's sake? Seriously? Anyone who knows their mythology knows that Pandora's Box contained all the world's evil. It's like saying ""I know, we'll call it Deathworld, that sounds nice right?"".** A quick google search indicates that ""Unobtainium"" is the material that Oakley use to make the frames for their shades (check it out if you don't believe me). This suggest the fascinating concept that, in the future, Oakley sunglasses have become humanity's primary means of exchange.*** !BIG SPOILER! Which they unsurprisingly win – I couldn't help thinking that before the credits there would be a screen of text saying ""Three years after these events, humans returned to Pandora, cleansing its surface with nuclear fire""."
"Like the original 1977 ""Star Wars,"" this film at last raises the bar in terms of crafting a breathtakingly beautiful and mesmerizing alien world and its creatures. I predict there will be several copycat films that try to cash in on the Avatar ""look,"" and the film certainly will have a cult following. Though the movie is over two hours long, it presents such a rich tapestry and lively pace it flows by quickly. The film is so visually overwhelming that the storyline became secondary to me. No other sci-fi film in memory has so convincingly woven together and entire alien biosphere and pre-technological civilization. When I saw the blue ""Smurfs-on- steroid"" aliens in the trailers, I was afraid this would be a sappy tale. It is anything but. Many elements from Cameron's earlier films are obvious. Sigourney Weaver looks and acts like she just shipped out after her adventure in the movie ""Aliens."" The bioluminescent creatures of the moon Pandora are reminiscent of the aliens in ""The Abyss."" The fighter ships come straight from ""Terminator."" Cameron also heavily borrows designs from the ""Dinotopia"" fantasy book series.What I do find tiring is the heavy-handed environmentalism message that seems a prerequisite for otherworld fantasy films today. There is even a veiled allusion to the Bible's Tree of Life. Apparently the moon Pandora is a living Garden of Eden. That is, until those greedy, warlike, and arrogant humans come along. This is where the story gets weak and horribly contrived. The moon has some magnetic superconducting element not found anywhere else in the galaxy. And, the natives of Pandora just happen to be living on top of it. Talk about location, location, location.Never mind that the universe is collectively made of exactly the same bricks and mortar found in the periodic table of the elements. Or, that transporting an exotic element to Earth across interstellar space would be ridiculously expensive. It would be vastly cheaper to synthesize it on Earth.The film draws obvious parallels to the decimation of Native Americans by the New World colonists. The military bad guy's are straight out of Cameron's ""The Abyss."" Apparently humans are so evil they not only would strip mine a planet but also decimate its inhabitants. In reality our scientists would always have the upper hand in such a discovery simply because Pandorans don't vote for Congressmen. A moon like this would be just an astrobiology curiosity. It's totally implausible that any private corporation would have the resources to mount an interstellar gold rush.These story shortcomings aside, ""Avatar"" is still a powerfully engaging and memorable film. It's a long-awaited break from much less imaginative and utterly moronic story lines in most contemporary sci-fi films, such as ""District 9"" and ""2012."""
"In my opinion this movie is the best movie of the decade. Personally, it launched itself into my own personal top 5 of all time...maybe even number 1 after I reflect more on my experience. The movie is a magical experience. You will hear ""critics"" bash the plot as something that has already been done and/or reminds us of about 5 different movies in one. However, I reject these critics analysis because what movie can't you say that about? I once heard there are only around 56 stories in existence, and they keep being retold over and over again in different varieties and with different characters. So the fact that the story is one that is common to us (i.e. an outsider realizes that his own people are the evil and takes sides with aliens to vanquish his own, e.g. Dances with Wolves) doesn't bother me. I think the writing is excellent, the dialog superb, the special effects mind-blowingly amazing, and the story emotionally uplifting (i.e. it may bring a tear to your eye and force you to look at your fellow man a little differently regardless of the color of their skin or gender). To me this experience was beautiful and will be with me for a long time. I suggest this movie to EVERYONE, in IMAX 3D if possible."
"I like this movie, good story, nice animations, good actors, spectacular 3d effects!!"
"If you like fantasy or science fiction, then you will love avatar. This movie is a perfect blend of science fiction and fantasy, and they are thematically tied together wonderfully. The world is well built, and it shows. The effects are impossibly well polished and has perfect cgi animals, so good that you don't notice.
In Avatar, the plot centres around using science fiction and fantasy to show how wonderful James Cameron is at worldbuilding. At its core it is a very good excuse to show off how well built it is. However, just because it is good for showing off James Cameron's worldbuilding prowess, it still manages a flawless romantic subplot, tieing it back into the main story, as well as an epic climax, and a perfect display of the Even in the climax, James Cameron beautifully drives his worldbuilding unintrusively into every second.
My favorite scene is when Jake follows Neytiri towards her village, and when he is standing on a branch, the seeds of the sacred tree all cluster on his chest. The thing that makes this so special is that is showcases how magical James Cameron's world is. Despite magic not actually existing, he manages to weave it in. The effects are there, but not obvious. It is only because these drifting pollen things cannot be controlled in such a way that we even notice that they are there. It exemplifies the fact that Avatar is a CGI movie, and the amazing possibilities that it allows for. This scene could not be achieved with practical effects, but it does not overdo CGI, by not pushing it too far, and it shows how it can be used in a profound action-free scene which can require it.
In Avatar, one of the best written characters was Parker Selfridge, the guy in charge of the corporate part of the company that sends humans to Pandora. He is very dismissive of the idea that the Na'vi have any benefits at all. His character shows frustration with the Na'vi and this is at the core of his character, and his perceived uncooperativity of the Na'vi makes him very relatable. He is clearly stressed, and projects blame, something that we all do, onto the Na'vi, who he calls ""flea bitten savages"". He is also not quite a clear cut villain, at least until Grace gives her speech to try and get him to turn, and without consideration says ""what have you been smoking"" and this shows his single minded obsession with keeping doing what they are doing, regardless of the natural internet beneath their feet. His true centre is his closed-mindedness.
Avatar is an incredible movie with perfectly subtle CGI, beautiful worldbuilding, and a well structured plot. Through his wonderful blend of science fiction and fantasy tropes, James Cameron, with full creative control, brought these two genres, both birthed in the romantic movement, together to build a wonderous world and wrote an incredible plot to flow through, and serve it. With his immense ability to explain things just enough, he strikes a good balance that shows that while Pandora is basically fairyland, it is a realistic fairyland."
"Avatar is James Cameron's child in waiting for longer than a decade. Twelve years since Titanic Cameron again delivers with a great science fiction epic with the usual tropes and clichés but somehow making it work. The film looks gorgeous and the planet Pandora will surely give nature pangs to many of us. It makes me wonder how much a great storyteller's skills matter- Everything and everyone was against Cameron and somehow, he has managed to deliver. If you haven't seen Avatar(how?) you should see it as soon as possible- this is a great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker."
"I brought 2 boxes of Goobers to see Avatar... unfortunately for me I needed to have brought 4 boxes! Think the storyline of ""Furn Gully"" all grown up and using the Tech of ""The Matrix"" with the heart and Soul of the story line right out of ""Braveheart""! Enough said.This is the extraneous stuff you do not need to read to know that you need to go see this film. Unfortunately I need Ten lines of text! The acting was superb, The graphics unparalleled, the sound was Tres' Magnifique! I can not await the arrival of a heartwarming ""Mechwarrior"" film that really needs to be made! the tech is here and in place lets get on with it people! :)Well done James... Well Done! (Bows and tips hat)"
"I waited over 1.5hrs in the queue to watch AVATAR. well I must say that it was worth the time and double or triple the money I spent on it... Fist I loved Terminator as a kid... then Alien 2 and T2... With T2 he borough 3D animated characters alive in the big screen.... followed by the massive Titanic. And today he has definitely revolutionized history of film making with AVATAR. Unfortunately I got to see the normal 2D version of it coz we don't get iMax theaters in our country yet... it did the magic. the AVATAR's and the Na'vis were really acting... Pandora was real... amazing art direction.... they have made a whole universe a real world out in that big screen. The details they have gone in to is just amazing. OK I'm just over-hyped after seeing the movie.... No its seriously amazing and hats off to Cameron and the crew. Talking about the story... it's simple yet flowing nicely where you get attached to. I fell in love with Neytiri.. :) Behind the plot it speaks to all the humans living in this planet earth about a common big issue which we don't realize or ignore. So there's lot more to get from AVATAR than the amazing graphics. I'm waiting to get the DVD with all the extras and the making of footages of the film. So go ahead enjoy and take the message of AVATAR... I'm sure there will be more to come in the future or better and new revolutions of movie making, but AVATAR is already a Classic... and in my opinion it should remain as it is with out sequels..."
You should atleast give credit to childrens books or movie which you copied from
"This movie has already been made, it's called Dances With Wolves. Think about the two movies and you will know what I am talking about. It's also way to computer generated for me, it looks fake and stupid. It reminds me of Star Wars 1-3. The Cameron magic failed in this lame movie. There was really nothing about this movie that I liked except that Sigourney Weaver was in it."
"I've been using IMDb forever and watching at least 5 movies a month. Never before have I felt the urge to comment on a movie. But this is different. I'd like to reach out to whom thinks that Avatar is just another big budget sci-fi blockbuster. Yes it is that also. But Avatar is so much more than a sci-fi movie; it's a total new experience. 3D adds a great deal to the movie but it's such a complete movie that it wouldn't be effected that much even it weren't shot in 3D. It has emotion, originality in the making and the world it presents, action, story line and acting, too. Please go see it (probably more than once). You won't regret it."
"Rather than being a great movie and best effects ever seen till now, I have to share that I have lived another life in this movie, maybe in a world inside Cameron's mind.This is not just a movie, its an amazing experience that you'll feel like you are in a dream and you do not want this dream to end.No one can just describe AVATAR in words, its just so strange, you when you experience some thing for the first time, and its so strange but at the same time it gives you the absolute pleasure and then you get addicted and you want more and more and more..This how it felt like watching it and James Cameron gave the audience more more more ...until the end.Movies must be at this level of production from now on! AVATAR have set a new Era for movies."
"I watched this yesterday and wow i am still amazed by it the next day. The story is so brilliant, makes you feel inside the movie itself, even more so in 3D. Buying the game at this moment as that has also got great reviews. There isn't anything better that you could spend £5 on, pretty much anyone would love this film, cant fault any of it; scenery is beautiful, makes me want to live there (apart from the vicious animals). In the same day i also watched Stardust on DVD which the first time i watched it i found to be a very good movie, however maybe it was because i had already watched it or maybe it was because it was only on DVD but after watching avatar just hours before it was like watching an old 90s film, not a scratch off of avatar. If i could marry a movie it would be this one!"
"This is a turning point for cinema.James Cameron has foregone the hokey throwing the Axe at the screen 3-D to forge a subtle, immersing, action adventure.It is the work of someone who is truly in control of his vision and is capable of bringing it to the screen.Put simply, amazing film, with s powerful performance at its center(hello Zoe Saldana)!Not since The Matrix has there been a film that had to be seen at the Cinema.Do yourself the favour. 10/10"
"I am not a big scifi fan... Now that I have stated that, this movie was the amazing. At one point my legs actually went numb from excitement. that is a rare that movie can be so on the edge of your seat thrilling that it actually makes Ur legs go numb.. I was highly upset when my children would not leave me alone to go get popcorn.. SO i did miss little of the movie but not enough to where I didn't know what was going on... So if u are looking for an action packed, heart warming, gut thrilling, leg numbing movie please i beg u go see this movie.. It is well worth the price they charge for admissions, and BTW i will deff be buying this as soon as it come out on DVD... it gets a 10 from me!!!!"
"After being out of the public eye since Titanic(1997), his comeback film Avatar proves to serve him right.Way forward in the future a crippled marine(Sam Worthington), becomes apart of an experiment, When he is hooked up to machine, it can put his mind and soul in the body of a 8 foot tall blue alien, and has to go undercover on there planet, to get some of there resources, but things change when he falls in love with one of the alien warriors(Zoe Saldana).This film is quite a masterpiece, it's mind blowing in any effects and storytelling ever. Sam Worthington who stole last years Terminator Salvation from a cranky Christian Bale, really does well here. So does Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver. A great comeback for James Cameron."
"I waited for 30 minutes in the morning to watch Avatar and it was worth the wait. Avatar was a spectacular and heart-warming journey about a battle between the humans and the natives. Watching it in 3D enhanced the visuals, and I have to admit, they were perfect. The story line was great - a bit shaky at the start - but was later explained throughout the movie. It really is emotional at the end when you see many of the natives dying to protect their land and you really want them to survive. It has a few humorous lines though it is more of a fantasy/drama/adventure movie. The audio was also great, especially with all the strange new creatures discovered. I don't want to spoil the movie, but this is the best movie I have ever seen in a long time and a long time to come. James Cameron, yet again, has made another fantastic and spell binding movie from his previous success, ""Titanic"" which was another movie that made a mark in my heart. Audio, Visuals, Storyline, Actors perfect - this is the must see movie of the century."
"As a visual spectacle Avatar is unmatched but as a film everyone in the world has seen this couple of times before.The movie is simply a sub par film pushed into billion dollar territory (and inevitable ""classic"" calls) by 3-d glasses and a $250 million dollar budget. But it's still worth your $10. Pandora - the homeworld of the Na'vi - is an incredible feat of technical wizardy. Seeing the film in 3-D, the foliage and the creatures of this world look almost as if there from some fantastic dream about flying. Scenes such as when Sully (Andrew Worthington) and Neyriti (Zoe Saldana) race flying creatures down the sheer face of a cliff feel as if they're happening more on the inside of your head than on a screen. They are real and alive. Still as the Phantom Menace showed, technical wizardy does not mean a memorable story. Sully is a brat at the beginning and then far too earnest at the end. The Na'vi are far too forgiving, the battles too predictable. Colonel Stephen Lang (Sorry, Colonel Miles Quatrich) is a 3-D villain with 2-D motivation and the only interesting character is Sigourney Weaver's Gracie who plays both a mother to Sully (There are some genuinely touching scenes between her and Worthington) and friend to Na'vi. In fact, it seems that Gracie is the only character throughout the film whose desire remains altruistic. Sully -our intrepidly predictable hero- manages to obtain leadership of the Na'vi through conquering a dragon or something, but his redemption feels tacked on. Neyriti manages to stay interesting as Sully's love interest - I almost wish she'd just start talking about Na'vi hunting techniques instead of exchanging in some awfully written banter with Sully. If you watched 'Titanic' or (as South Park pointed out) 'Dances with the Wolves' and Jeremy Iron's 'The Mission' than you know Avatar. It's about understanding native ways of life, of understanding our roots as members of a 'network of energy' (Avatar comes oh-so-close to calling this the Force) and trying really, really, hard not to destroy it all with futuristic gunships and robots. I'll be honest we -as a movie going public- need this message now and again but this has been done much, much better. Notably by the aforementioned 'The Mission.' But where these films simply showed and not preached, Avatar preaches and it preaches hard. The only problem is that we're all in the choir, James."
"When I first heard about Avatar, earlier this year and I saw the trailers, I didn't had high expectations. I thought it was a movie filled with special effects, but with no original or interesting story, a movie where I could not care about the characters, like ""King Kong"" for example; I was mistaken. Visually, the movie is unlike anything I've ever seen in a cinema. And it's not only that, the movie has a soul.The story focuses on Jake Sully, a paraplegic U.S. marine, who in he future, travels trough space to the planet Pandora, a planet inhabited by the Na'vi, an indigenous alien race( although they have blue skin, they are very similar to humans). There he becomes involved with the Avatar project, and he submits himself to a process in which his consciousness is transferred to a Na'vi body. The military on Pandora are interested in a very rare and precious material, a sort of mineral, called Unobtanium. There are large quantities of this material in the place where the Na'vis live. Jake, in Avatar form, infiltrates the Na'vi, in order to gather Intel for the military, and if possible, convince the Na'vis to relocate. While living with them, Jake learns about their culture, their way of life and he starts to see the world trough their eyes. He practically becomes one of them, and he also falls in love with a Na'vi woman,Neytiri. The military are about to launch an attack against the Na'vi, and Jake is going trough an identity crisis, he has to find out who he is, and he has to choose a side in the imminent battle.James Cameron outdid himself with this movie,the motion capture technology used to create the Na'vi is just as good as the one used to create Gollum, in ""The Lord of the Rings"". It's hard to believe that there were no shootings done in a real forest, it all looks incredibly real. The movie is visually extraordinary, and as I said before, it has a soul. While watching the movie, you come to care about the characters, the Na'vis specially. This movie got to me in a way that only "" The Lord of the Rings- The Return of the King""( my favorite movie of all time) had got before. In the scene where the military launch their first attack against the Na'vi, destroying a part of their forest and killing some of them, I had to make an effort not to cry, my eyes were full of tears, and that is something that rarely happens to me, REALLY, rarely. The movie has a strong message of love and peace, it is an anti-war and anti-military movie, and also has a strong spiritual side. The way the Na'vis respect the nature, the animals and above all, life itself, is a lesson to all human beings. James Cameron had done great movies in the past, but never something as bold as this. To my eyes now, he is just as brilliant as a filmmaker as Peter Jackson is, and that's saying a lot. This movie is certainly going to be remembered as a milestone in movie making."
"Have IQ's dropped sharply while I was gone? The overwhelming special effects of Avatar simply cannot hide the vacuousness of its story. As just about anyone who can read has noticed, the plot is a rehash of the ""civilised man goes native"" fable popularized from ""Last of the Mohicans"" to the present day (I'm sure even the ancient Egyptians have a version preserved in hieroglyphs somewhere on a dusty temple wall). The CGI is realistic enough that you can become engaged with the digital characters... except, then your attention is focused on the story. Which is almost as lame as a 6th graders summer vacation essay.I did not see the movie in 3D as I assumed it would be pointlessly distracting. I have seen polarized 3D movies before. Starting with one of the first, ""The Bubble"" in the late 60's. The peak of this in-your-face technology was reached years ago in the 70's with the release of ""The Stewardesses"". Nothing in this movie can compete with real 3D boobs."
"Really how did it?The story is paper thin and pathetic. ""Unobtainium"". Really? That's the best you could come up with James Cameron? Why didn't you call your explosives ""kaboomium.""All I have heard anyone say about this film is how great the cinematography for this movie was. Fine. I'm not arguing the cinematography, but the rest of the movie is total piece of crap. It's 2 hours and 15 minutes of a live action version of Fern Gully followed by a 25 minute battle scene that by the time you actually get to that you don't even care because you're so viciously bored that your eyes are bleeding.I can think of dozens of movies that had great cinematography that didn't come close to grossing what this piece of crap did. Then the DVD comes out and all people say is that what really made Avatar great was the 3D. Well, the DVD isn't in 3D so why are you buying it?The raters on this website have Avatar rated as a better movie than; The Wizard of Oz, Ben Hur, Toy Story 1 & 2, The Graduate, Duck Soup, Scarface, Rocky (which I'm not a big fan, but it's still a much better movie than this piece of crap), Spartacus, and on and on and on. That's insanity. Yeah 8 more minutes of this movie? Are you trying to make it worse? Is that even possible? I went into seeing this movie with absolutely no expectations and it didn't even exceed that. Everyone I know loves it and no one can give me a single reason why other than it looked good. There is absolutely no story to this movie whatsoever! How are people giving it a 10 based solely on cinematography? It shouldn't be given higher than a 3 based on solely cinematography. Then you factor it lacks everything else from story to decent acting and you can give it a 1.How embarrassing that this piece of garbage is rated this high on this website. Notice how it didn't win any Oscar outside of the visual category. It didn't even win best movie from the academy of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror film for crying out loud. 8.3? This should have a rating of 1.3."
"Now, my judgement, my opinion of this film may be clouded as I am a big James Cameron fan. I go by Directors when it comes to many films, and it just so happens Cameron is right up there in my top 5.I've been waiting for a while to see Avatar. Friends have seen it, friends of friends have seen it, and last night, it was my turn.Stunning. I couldn't believe it. Visually, the film is a master piece. Cameron deserves the recognition I hope he will get after this film. The 3D element is, without a doubt, the best so far. You get a real sense of depth when you see this film in 3D. It actually makes Pandora (the planet where the film is set)a character of the film in itself.I was hesitant about this film when I heard you could see it in complete 3D. After seeing Superman Returns, and a few other films in 3D, I was unimpressed with 3D. The moment Avatar started, I dribbled. My eyes were being fed a visual feast that, I believe, would never be topped. The depth and feel you get from it are amazing. There were a few scenes in the forest of Pandora, at night, and the different plant life there comes alive with colour, neon blues, red, greens, you honestly do feel like you can reach out, and touch it.The story itself was good too. Though, in some ways a bit predictable, but you get sucked in and forget that and spend the next 2hrs 40 mins thinking you're there.It's the 3D element, and the visual effects that make this film. Yes, Sam Worthington and Sig Weaver add great performances, but it is the effects that made it for me. MAKE SURE YOU GO AND SEE THIS IN 3D. It'll be the best 2 hrs 40 mins you've ever spent in a cinema.....EVER."
"This is the best movie I have ever seen.. ever. The Dark Knight can say goodbye. My favorite movie is Avatar, and just in time. 2009 is almost over. Nothing like Avatar to end the year. I was just about to feel very awful at the end under I saw the main character, who's name I still haven't really gotten (I think it's Jack) survive. He's still alive.An alien world, similar to Earth's prehistoric times. The times of dinosaurs. Giant birds that you have never seen alive, and indegenous people that live their (unlike Earth had as far as we know.) We came there for a rock. Yep, a rock that sells for millions of dollars. If the indegenous don't leave, sucks for them, it's our land. We've created clones of the indegenous peoples that we put our Humans in, and Jack was one of them. He later realizes that we are very wrong, and will go against his race.Nothing like the giant big army guy boss dying at the end to make this movie feel excellent. I really loved it. There's nothing more I can say, and I doubt that this review will be on the front, but this will really be your best movie, too."
"First of all id like to apologize for my bad English. I just have a different opinion of this movie, and i thought maybe some one else shares it with me. To begin with the part the all people loved (so did i), the effects. What can i say? they were great. Its obvious why the film ate 400 mil. Imax delivers almost real life experience, and the feeling is absolutely amazing. Doesn't matter how rich is your imagination, you never saw this coming. Cameron will just surprise you with landscapes, color, action, effects, all of it. Every detail is carefully taken care of, and the result is 100% life-like everything. The music was also great. It blends perfectly with the action and story. I remember the same feeling from lotr. I said to myself ""i got to download this when i get home"". The story on the other hand was used before, nothing new. But the way it was implemented is somehow different. From the beginning to the end i felt trapped in the characters skin. I forgot all about the popcorn and soda, and i experienced almost everything that jake experienced. I discovered a whole new world, and this might sound childish, but just like jake, i fell in love with it. I think this ruined it for me. The na'vi don't have spaceships, television, mobile phones, they don't have money, and they don't have guns. I realized that us humans have A LOT to learn from those simple creatures with only bows and arrows. They are much better than us in so many ways. Overall the film is perfect, but at the end i was sad because i woke up from the beautiful dream that it was for me.I saw this on Christmas eve, and even though i didn't get any presents from Santa for quite a while now, that night i wished that we could all change, and of course that i wake up as jake sully :)."
"Just having watched the movie and its hard to come by the words to describe it. James Cameron has just set a new standard for a blockbuster. A standard which is highly unlikely to be competed with in the near future.From the moment it began to the very end was just mind blowing. Although it might take a while to get used to the 3D, the effects and the graphics were outstanding! It will be quite hard to step back down to movies we are used to seeing nowadays. It'll also be interesting to see if Cameron makes a sequel to this masterpiece. Was apparently initially intended to be a three part series..."
"The story is one of the most unoriginal i've ever seen. The CGI is as good as they say but who cares? The best CGI in the world can't save a movie this bad. The acting is sub-par. I didn't find a single character to be one I could be sympathetic with. There are basically two sides, the tree hugging hippie natives and the Hitler-esquire humans who just wanna kill anyone who doesn't agree with them. The action is almost all at the end and even then its not very good. As you have probably heard the story is basically the same as Pocahontas. This is 100% true. As I touched on earlier the acting is not good. I wanted to strangle pretty much every single character throughout the entire movie. It's almost like they were trying to be unlikeable."
"The most cliché ridden movie I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. This is the result of James Cameron taking the most transparent parts of proceeding Oscar winnings films, sticking them into a blender and pouring the resulting cliché milkshake onto film. It is tedious beyond belief. Within 10 minutes one can easily predict what will happen. I've seen less predictable episodes of The Brady Bunch. I wont rant about the one dimensional characters, done to death plot or the name of the mineral (unobtanium ??!?!?! hahahaha sorry), they've been covered adequately in other reviews.Let me just say pretty does not mean brilliant. Because pretty it is. However if I want pretty, I'll take a short trip to the country side. I wanted 3 hours of entertainment. Not 3 hours of staring at a rainbow.Avoid if you have a semblance of intelligence and expect artists to be creative."
"This was definitely a complete masterpiece. I can not name one single flaw with the movie. It had everything from amazing visual effects, spectacular acting, a story line that keeps you interested above and beyond, wrapped up into one amazing movie. The Pandora world Cameron has produced was so pure, beautiful, and surreal. The Avatar people were amazing and even the little details were genius work. It makes you want to become an Avatar and live in this fantasy world. I really can not even put into words how in awe I was of James Cameron's work. This movie spoke to me in so many different ways. I hope that everyone has a chance to see this!"
"James Cameron's Avatar is a breath of fresh air. Although the story itself is one that we have seen before in the likes of Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai of a man who falls in love with a way of life and has to choose between what he knows and what he loves, Cameron's masterstroke is in setting the story on another world and so it is not restrained by certain parameters which leaves him free to tell an emotional story. The performances by the actors are fine and all invoke the emotions of there characters eg Giovanni Ribisi plays the Corporate bad guy perfectly. However it is James Cameron's ability to make you fall in love with a world that does not exist which makes this film work. People remark that it is a work of art which you will have to decide for yourself. In all this is a must see movie and I believe will collect a lot of Oscars."
"Avatar was really a spectacular movie. The special effects and cg graphics were awesome! It truly reflected the five years of work and millions of dollars that went into it. The story, although not very original, was very inspiring. The story is about a marine named Jake who is paralyzed waist down. His brother died, so Jake had to take his place. Jake has to go to this planet called ""Pandora"", where the humans are in conflict with the aliens. Jake, through the Avatar project, which put him in an alien body, learned more about the aliens and started to question how justified the humans were in coming to the planet. Jake even goes as far as to fall in love with a really hot alien woman (I won't tell you who, you will have to find out). I will not ruin the ending; I will just say that Jake makes a very inspiring speech to the aliens close to the end of the movie. That was somewhat similar to William Wallace's speech to the army in the movie ""Braveheart"". The characters were well thought out, designed, and animated. The cg aliens looked very real, living and breathing. The only real downside of the movie are the unoriginal story. Otherwise the movie was purely incredible!"
"I loved this film, every single second of it.The world was totally absorbing and I was filled with excitement just exploring this new world with our hero. I found the romance between the characters touching and believable; the dialogue and performance was amazing.The fight scenes are also utterly brilliant, I gasped as arrows, bullets and creatures went flying past me. I strongly recommend this film, words simply can't do it justice and I am convinced it will go down in movie history as a milestone for cinema.The ticket was worth every penny; a remarkable film that truly demands your undivided attention on the big screen. See it now, you won't regret it."
"With all the hype about Avator I thought that Hollywood had finally made a blockbusting film that was both intelligent and subtle. How wrong I was! Computer generated visual vomit in which gun-ho marines endeavour to annihilate feeble alien beings until one of morons jumps ship and saves the alien nation and thus becomes their leader.A script written on the back of a cigarette packet that basically tells us how totally awesome America is and how they can both destroy us or be our savior. The film is aimed at men with small penises, men with the mental ages of 14 year old's, men who masturbated over computer generated alien women and men who are socially inept."
"When I left my flat to see a screening of Avatar earlier, I noticed a beautiful, thin, orange sliver of a crescent moon in the sky, and it was, from my perspective, sitting just above the cinema I was going to and I thought 'How beautiful, I hope it's a sign of how good this film is going to be.' It was.What other action director has a heart as big as Jim Cameron? Remember the way he brought Linsay back to life and how she and Virgil fall in love with each other all over again in The Abyss? The relationship between Arnie's terminator and young John Connor in T2? The romance at the heart of True Lies? And then he gave us the emotional mega-whammy of 'Titanic'! Now he delivers a film with not only a beautiful love story at it's heart, but suggests that there is a planet somewhere on which every inhabitant is completely in tune with every other creature and the planet's ROOTS in such a way that if and when it's existence is threatened, they all come together to defend it....Any director who goes to the trouble of INVENTING the technology needed to see his vision come to life the way he wants and the patience to disappear off the radar for 12 years, painstakingly making sure it looks and feels and sounds exactly as he envisioned it deserves a new category of Academy Award. Most Groundbreaking Film of the Year award perhaps? About half an hour into watching this film, I realised I was watching it as a film critic, looking for flaws, then I turned that part of my mind off and decided to just let myself enjoy the story, and the effects, and the music, and the colours, and the humour....Yes, we have seen the basic story before, it does resemble Dances With Wolves and The Last Samurai, and Cameron sets it all up a bit quickly and too easily, but I can think of no other director who can take such familiar material and inject it with such joyous, ecstatic enthusiasm. It does take a while to build up, but until the action really kicks off just sit back and soak up the beauty of what you are seeing (the reinvention of how films are made). Incidentally, don't go in expecting any shocking moments of things seemingly flying out of the screen, it's not that kind of 3D film (although there are little white spidery type things that seem to dance in front of the screen), the 3D here just invites you in, in fact I'm looking forward to seeing it again in 2D just to enjoy the emotion of it, and again in IMAX to really get the full monty, and probably again just because it has to be seen on a big screen before it leaves cinemas, but I suspect that is a long way off.Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich take note, the master is back, and he has pushed 'the boat' out yet again.Edited 24/12/09....I have been watching this films position on IMDBs highest grossing movies of all time and it has jumped from #295 to #240 in 24 hours!!! So to all you naysayers, whether you like it or not, something about this film has captured people's imaginations and hearts just like Titanic did. According to my calculations, all Avatar has to do is perform like this for another month or so and it will be neck and neck with Titanic as far as gross ticket sales is concerned, and I couldn't be happier!!"
"Sure, the effects ARE excellent- but what a dreadful waste of effects. Surely, at some point, someone must have pointed out to the powers that be that the film contains nothing new. If a film like this wins any awards for anything except special effects it is, surely, an indictment of the low value we put on original (or even interesting) work. The elements of a wonderful story COULD be there but it seems that the special effects budget was more important than the screen writing budget. Dreadfully disappointed with the film and hope that others see it for ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" that it is. Come on Hollywood you can do far better than this!"
"As the pandering Frankenstein that is the new Star Wars ""movie"" steamrolls its way toward dethroning Avatar's (inexplicable) preeminence, I thought I'd finally get around to copping a squat on this most mind-bogglingly absurd success story.As with The Force Awakens, people just couldn't hand over their money fast enough, and as with The Force Awakens, I have absolutely no idea why. Because I'll just never be on board with the one & only ""argument"" for this movie: ""the effects are really great and it looks like a lifelike world to escape into"". Or some variation of such.But notice that *serious* components of story-telling don't get mentioned... stuff like story lines, acting... you know, crap like that. Instead, it would seem that this movie reached $2.7 billion because it's ""pretty"".Okay, so it looks nice... right?Nope. In fact, I was so overwhelmingly disappointed with ALL of the effects that I just could not reconcile myself with the fact that people became so obsessed with ""Pandora"" that many of them were seriously depressed when the movie ended. The blue people themselves were unusually inexcusable in this regard. What the hell were the masses smoking before going into theaters around the world?This, incidentally, is one of those ""life lesson"" moments, especially for the 21st century: if you're so disconnected from the real world that you need shallow entertainment to break free of your own self-imposed mental prison, then...GO OUTSIDE. Seriously.There's a whole world out there! Sights! Sounds! Living things! Or just switch over to PBS once in a while. You'll see critters that don't look stupid! There really is life beyond James Cameron's (allegedly) plagiarized movie, folks.And to address an amusingly secondary factor of the film-making process: the actual storyline. I remember back in ""the old days"" when I would hear about Director's Cuts, and how superior they must have been to the versions of movies that got past the studios, focus groups, etc. But boy, did this movie change that.Avatar is a prime example of what happens when no one says NO. This whole thing just felt like a rough draft. From repeated lines to extraneous dialogue, it felt like a significant rush job (not least because the effects were so surprisingly weak as well).One glaring example that stood out for me: the assessment of the dangers the military would be facing. Early in the movie, it was described as ""worse than hell out there"", and yet it's also shown that the worst the blue people could do was fire arrows into tires so massive that they didn't even have an impact.And sure enough, the later onslaught was met with such flimsy resistance that The Bad Guy was calmly sipping coffee in a flying vehicle during a major firefight. ""Worse than hell""? Why, because he risked his coffee cooling to room temperature?I don't get it. I never will. The only high point of the movie, as far as I'm concerned, was Michelle Rodriguez's low neckline. I'll never get sick of seeing that woman with a gun.But do a few shots of cleavage make up for two and a half hours of smurf puke? That, friends, is what we call a rhetorical question. Look it up."
"OK, so I made a first attempt at some sort of review of Avatar and failed miserably. I tried to make it sound to fancy, filled it with a bunch of crap, blah blah blah. Anyway, I have to say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen If not the best. Now, I know that is quite a bold statement but hey, I'm the kind of person to make statements like that. To a sci-fi/fantasy geek like me, Avatar was THE next big thing, the movie I waited a year for. I ordered midnight tickets to the IMAX, got there and hour early to pick out a good seat, etc. I literally sat through the movie with a huge smile on my face. Never have I felt so satisfied walking out of a movie.Now a lot of the complaints focus on weak story and weak acting. To be honest, the acting in my opinion was fine. I'm not going to say that I will bow down to Sam Worthington but all the actors did a great job, particularly Zoe Saldana. I don't know if it was their portrayal, or the way the characters were written, but I found myself actually caring for the characters. Call me cold-hearted, but I couldn't have cared less if Frodo died in Lord of the Rings. The only people I cared for in those movies were Gandlaf and Aragorn. I don't like over-emotional characters, it simply bogs down the story. In this movie, I found myself caring for the main characters, on the edge of my seat during the finale.One of the amazing things Cameron does is he has the guts to kill off nearly any character. He killed almost everyone in Aliens, everyone but the main in Terminator, and killed of poor Leo in Titanic. When characters started going in this movie, I got a little nervous for the leads. That tells me something! The fact that I was nervous for movie characters indicated to me that these were characters I truly cared about, that I wanted to live. In regards to to the story, ye sits predictable but so is everything. Originality is not in the destination always but in the journey. Just because we know the ending doesn't make the scenes leading up to it boring. I was engaged by the entire movie start to finish despite predicting what would happen.The music, although I hear it copies a lot of Horner's previous work, felt perfect to me. I consider myself I bit of a movie music snob. I believe music can either make or break a movie, its that essential. It has to provide a great ""feel"" if you know what I'm saying. Some scenes in this movie left me in awe not only with the effects but the music as well. I love the use of choir and chanting in a film's score and there was plenty here. It just made me feel as if this was truly an ""epic"" movie, I don't know how to explain it.I am not going to claim I am some movie critic and know all. I certainly don't and I am not here to analyze this film for all it's worth. I just know that a movie never made me feel this way before. I have seen it three times and I am dying to see it again. I listen to the soundtrack on an hourly basis. Hell, the IMDb page is my internet homepage and I regularly visit the Avatar Wiki. When I have left the theatre each time, I feel depressed, wishing I could see more, wishing our world was more like Pandora. I felt so connected throughout the entire movie that it was just frustrating to leave. Any movie that makes me feel this way is certainly considered by me to be one of the best movies ever. It's something I feel rather then something I can analyze. 10/10"
"PREAMBLE: This review has been deleted. It was done so based on another user suggestion. I'm not sure why, so I deleted some dirty words that might offend some ""users"". I'm reposting it now with slight changes and some notes in brackets {}.I'm not going to try call the art 'where are thee?' because Avatar isn't trying pretend to be deep anyway. However I'm very concerned about the amount of the 10/10 reviews here at IMDb. It probably shows something. People don't think anymore, they want candy. So they got it. But you can't feed on candy only, you know. At the time when I'm writing this review, Avatar sits on the 24th position of the TOP250, between 25th Silence of the Lambs and 23th Once Upon a Time in the West.OK, so what's wrong? Story - Main character, Jake, infiltrates a tribe of aliens on some planet. This tribe resides on the source of some highly expensive mineral. The tribe must be wiped out because of it. Jake starts to like his new friends, because they seem to be cool and in harmony with their nature. He also fell in love with female alien, Nscho-tschi, er... Neytiri. Battle between humans and aliens. The end. -- Well, not only has been this around thousand times over and over again, but it (go figure!) might have taken some bits from the history as well. Dances with Wolves have been mentioned in some reviews and I can think of even more accurate example - Enemy Mine (1985). Wiping the native Americans was a damn shame from any angle, but please, we all have got the point that it was wrong, OK? Get over it and don't breed the hate among the... {offensive words removed}. If you need some movie history lesson from this area, go see the Little Big Man (1970), the plot is exactly the same, only you won't need the 3D goggles.Script - None. The pattern could have been written by anybody, who has seen the standard action flicks. First few minutes, we get the direct explanation about what, where, who and why. And you know this type of explanation, right? Actors talking to each other and explaining the situation, like they never met before. The lecture from Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) given to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, why?) in their first dialog raised my palm to my face. The intellect of the audience has been lowered down again. Then standard romantic part with a twist in second part, the main character is obviously the chosen one, because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too. The aliens win the final battle and the lead character becomes one of them. Duh.Actors and setting - Who the hell need actors when we've got CGI? I was in the theater with my brother, who plays computer games a lot. After we came out of the building, he named me several things, which have been taken out straight from several PC games, like Command and Conquer, Heroes of Might and Magic, Warcraft and so on. So another rip-off.Visual effects - You've got this right. But wait another 20 years. It's like silicon breast. Now it looks good on your 20 years old body, but wait another 20. I still can't believe the score on IMDb is based solely on visual effects. It's so wrong! I have a theory about the whole thing. I think Cameron has been paid a fortune to do this. Why? Let's say the movie entertainment industry has a problem, that people don't go to theaters anymore, because they can watch movies from home, especially when they can get it on piratebay, right? So the industry needs a new type of movies. Movies with lame story, lame script, lame everything, but top CGI, 3D, IMAX, ultra-mega-realistic screening, so the movie downloaded from the internet is, in fact, useless. I've got nothing against this strategy. I don't give a damn about these mindless flicks, but they just don't belong among the TOP250, that's why I went to see Avatar. Out of curiosity. And my jaw did drop. From a shame where the intellect of the majority is going. I'm also ashamed that I went there and paid the money to see it. It's utterly trash. {section with ""dirty"" movies has been removed}0/10."
"I've seen some of James Cameron's movies. Titanic is powerful, AND SO IS AVATAR! I can't really call it a film. It's beyond that - IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ADVENTURE! I was more than interested when I saw the trailer, and after reading the plot outline on IMDb, I HAD to see it! At first, I was interested with the opening sequence and the mining operation on Pandora in the year 2154. The Na'vi had my eyes fixed on them throughout the entire adventure! I want to join them and I offer my love to them! In fact, blue is my favourite colour! Everyone involved with making this masterpiece did exceptionally brilliantly! I walked out of the cinema filled with excitement! When Jake explains how, when you're dreaming, sooner or later you have to wake up, I was thinking the same. I agree with this, but not if the dream isn't a dream, but reality. If I had to choose between following orders and protecting the Na'vi, I would choose to protect the Na'vi. I shared Jake's experience of not wanting to go back to Earth after seeing how amazing Pandora was, hearing words like, ""You have a strong heart,"" and ""One life ends, another begins,"" becoming one of the people – and falling in love. I have a strong and loving heart, and I learn things quickly. Love is a powerful sweetener to an incredible adventure.I enjoyed the scenes where Neytiri shows Jake how to fly the Ikran. I would say, ""Yah!"" with excitement before taking flight. My FAVOURITE scene is when Jake is initiated into the Omaticaya, and he and Neytiri choose each other. I LOVE the dialogue in that scene, and the romance is amazing! I would choose Peyral because she is a good hunter. (Who am I to choose someone who has already chosen?) I'm a good dancer and would use my moves and skills whilst learning to become one of the people. I also enjoyed the battle scenes, and I could feel the emotional outcome when Hometree was destroyed, (I was saddened by that) but to be honest, there were times during the adventure when I thought it would end, but I'm glad it didn't. (I know that James Cameron has confirmed the possibility of two sequels.) I LOVE the scenes where Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other clans to repel the humans. The final battle is very entertaining and the effects are incredible! I enjoyed every moment of it and felt as if I was in it and fighting alongside the Na'vi. I also felt a wave of relief and some pleasure when Neytiri killed Quaritch and saved Jake. I feel this way when good triumphs over evil. I remembered Titanic and was hoping that Jake would survive - and I was SO pleased when Neytiri saved him. That's another scene I TOTALLY LOVE - with the attack repelled, Neytiri and Jake reaffirm their love as she sees Jake in his human body for the first time. It's so beautiful! Love's complicated!As I watched the remaining corporate personnel being expelled from Pandora, while, Jake, Norm and other scientists were allowed to remain, it reminded me of a play I performed in in 2006. I'm VERY happy at the end when the clan performs the ritual that permanently transfers Jake from his human body into his Na'vi avatar. At some points in the adventure, I was actually hoping that would happen. I'm VERY pleased that it did! The ending's not bad at all, but I reckon that after Jake was transferred into his Na'vi avatar, Jake stood up, Neytiri smiled at him and they kissed. The people would then cheer!The experience is incredible and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for any sense of adventure! The words, ""I see you"" are powerful and effective and if I were transferred into a Na'vi avatar. (I would LOVE to actually!) those would be the first words I would say. The song ""I See You"" is also powerful and very effective. Thinking about it now, if I were with Jake at the end of the film, as a Na'vi avatar, I would say some of the many words the song involves. Speaking of the music, I noticed at times during the adventure, I heard two of the notes from Titanic's theme.I find that parts of a POWERFUL adventure stay with you after it's over, but this adventure is eternal! After the experiences I went through a few years ago, I'm NEVER going back to how I used to be. Love is my FAVOURITE emotion and it's EVEN STRONGER now that I've seen Avatar. Whenever I saw any stills or clips of Avatar, they struck my heart like love lightning - love SO strong! I have a strong heart and I believe that the power of love, more than just an emotion, but a strong feeling and/or affection, also plays a vital role in facing danger, having no fear, protecting others and standing together as one! Don't feel lost in love. Have the bravery the stand up and let it flow like a river of honey! Become one with the power of love! If your dreams become reality, and you are on Pandora, walking or flying with the Na'vi, you may see me there.Love, James."
"This movie was full of amazing effect, acting, etc etc as everyone has been saying. However there are 2 things about this movie that completely blew my mind. Firstly, the amount of creativity in the world they put on the screen. WOW! How do you come up with the plug in tails, the tree with the ancestors' voices, the animals, all of it! And its extremely amazing how realistic it all looks as well.One thing that I hope I'm not the only one seeing is the connection between this movie and the Native American hardships from the past. The culture of the Navi resembled something like the Native Americans who worshiped various aspects of nature and believed they all were connected. And the whole destruction and mourning seemed a lot like the Trail of Tears we learned about in high school.Anyway, I'll stick to the topic and say that this is really an extraordinary movie which truly deserves all of the praise and profit its getting. Here's to the return of sci fi!"
"This movie is enjoyable across all age groups and anyone who says differently is probably just being a killjoy.For example if you're the type of movie watcher who likes to point out things like ""McGuffins"" and ""Deus ex Machinas"" you may not be able to like a movie like this.Is there social commentary in this movie? Sure. But Sci Fi tends to lend itself to that. I personally didn't mind it at all hence my rating of 10. If you're sensitive to this kind of thing you may like the movie less than I did. But it is still 100 percent worth watching.Also special recognition should be paid to the cast here. Worthington is great as a new face who plays his role very adequately. Sigourney Weaver is a great addition. And Michelle Rodriguez brings some nice spirit to the production as well."
This is a MUST SEE movie in 3D and preferably in IMAX. James Cameron was very wise to wait for computer animation to catch up to his vision because OMG it's spectacular!There are more than a dozen animation studios world-wide who all contributed to a realism of graphics that has never before been so natural. Amazing considering that most of the movie is based on a new planet with all animals and most plants having totally new characteristics.The visuals and sounds/music is immersive & realistic. The story will leave you satisfied. All mature audiences will love it.This is NOT a typical multi-part comic book movie that always leaves you hanging.Go see it on the big screen and enjoy the BEST movie of all time!!
"Picture yourself going to an amusement park and ride THE best ride you have ever been on... This is how I feel today, and have felt even more intensely last night after having seen the avatar. I went to see this movie only because a friend of mine dragged me there. She didn't want to go alone and boy am I glad she did.Everything I want to say about this film has already been said on this site, so I'm just gonna add my comments to it. Yea so the story is something we all have seen plenty times before, nothing special there, but the execution of it is by far the best of it that I have seen...it's like eating chocolate, it always taste the same but sometimes the wrapping is so great that it makes you think the chocolate is The Best you have ever had :-) So if you want to just be entranced by another world and take a joy-ride of a colorful dream this movie is definitely for you!"
"I will not lie, i did not entirely agree with the messages that they put into this film on many many levels but because of everything else that went on in this movie i find absolutely no reason whatsoever to hold that against it. I watched this movie not more than ten minutes ago and found that it was the most entertaining, gut wrenching piece of art that i have ever witnessed. There were scenes that made me feel pains of sympathy inside my stomach along with the characters of the movie as well as times were i wanted kill out of hatred. The dialog could have used some work as well as the story line but it doesn't matter whatsoever. I will go to see this movie many times over and you should to, it is big it is bold and it will knock your socks off making you completely forget any price that you paid to go see it!"
"If you go to this movie expecting some totally original new concept you'll be disappointed, however if you realize that the ""original"" thing is pretty hard to do now a-days without getting really out there and want to see a good plot done really well then you'll be in for a treat. It is visually spectacular (must see it in IMAX 3D!!) and blasts through nearly 3hrs with ease. I was in awe all the way through and when I left the theater I was on the phone with my bro telling him he had to see it asap. It's funny, I bought my ticket online and was miffed that it cost damn near $15, thought ""this better be worth it!"" By the end I immediately decided to take my kids next week and will gladly pay for all three of us :) I loved this flick, it's in my top 5 for sure."
"you gotta give it to J.C ,i mean comm'on have you ever been this much stuck to the screen...yeah the story was loose and predictable as well ,the theme song was good but not quiet there ,but can you doubt his creativity ...there's no way you can go this far in a world of aliens and create such great aspects and environment so perfect that you cant even wonder how he did it...sure it wasn't complete but AVATAR is really something,such a great experience for me...i loved it the actors ,now SAM did good sigourney was perfect as always and oh my god how good was ZOE saldana who's so delicate and cute but tough in the movie as you can feel it in her heart..anyway please go and check this movie out Specially in IMAX cause you sure as hell will regret it if you went for 2d and even 3d..."
"One of the best films ever made. Avatar is full of emotion, interesting story lines, great scripts, and beautiful, incredible landscapes, creatures, and everything else. Cameron worked extremely well at bringing Pandora and the Na'vi to life. The expressions on their faces are the most real I have ever seen in animation. It's like watching actors! It's also nice to see a film with smaller actors...it gets repetitive seeing people like Brad Pitt fill 5 different roles...Sam Worthington is a great role for Jake Sully. Jake is hilarious and ignorant at first, but soon becomes a very big role model for the Na'vi. The films effects are incredible and the storyline, even though it has been done before, has a new ""fresh"" feel of it. This is the way movies should be made!"
"This is a masterpiece. This movie has the best effects ever seen and has a story which shows our world: The people who are able to see the force behind things you can't see and touch; and the people who lost this gift. If you compare it with other 3D-movies, no with all other movies, you can't find a movie with similar effects.Watch this movie! If you are not able to see the message behind this movie and if your heart isn't deeply touched - go to a psychiatrist and learn how to get back this feeling into your life.If you are able to feel this connection deep in your heart, say thanks for this gift."
"Avatar is a five-out-of-ten-star film. Not bad, but not excellent by any means.Avatar fails for several reasons: 1) It's a Vietnam film (albeit with a SF bent), many many years too late. The Vietnam film started with ""Apocalypse Now"" and finished with ""Full Metal Jacket"", and the canon includes everything in between. There was no reason to rehash it and nothing has been achieved by doing so. Cameron adds nothing to the Vietnam genre, nor the SF world.2) Despite the nice (but only ""nice"") backstory that exists for the Na'Vi and the white Americans (who represent all human beings, of course), the story itself is dull, predictable and not worth the time it takes to tell (some /ten-star/ reviews on IMDb even knowledge this - nuts!) In fact, story-wise it's a very expensive b-movie. The characters are unsympathetic (white knucklehead soldier has coming of age experience with foreign land/culture/woman; James Cameron forces another woman (or the same woman, for the second time) into a man's costume/role/story arc), and there are few surprises or story developments to reward our patience. The casting is also very woolly - Worthington, like his character, is expendible, Weaver chews scenery and channels too much Ripley, Rodriguez is rubbish /again/, and Lang is almost cartoonish (although, in many ways his performance sits the most comfortably).3) The Na'Vi are irritatingly orientalist. They are a quite unsubtle blend of the United States' lack of understanding of Asian and African cultures. While Sam Worthington's blundering has a certain quality of self-reflexiveness, ultimately, the Na'vi culture is a collection of ""preconceived archetypes which envision all 'Eastern' societies as fundamentally similar to one another, and fundamentally dissimilar to 'Western' societies."" 4) The digital looks crappy, even (especially?) in 3D. The neon green/blue palette does for cinema what it does for cars - makes it look falsely flash and after a while it reveals its shallowness. Also, the Na'Vi feel false, wooden, despite their 3D Mo-Cap yadda-yadda technology. Sorry, but Jim Henson's stuff still feels exponentially more real than this simply because the things captured by the camera WERE REAL! I would compare Avatar to the Hammer film ""One Million Years BC"": essentially a good b-movie with effects that are impressive but definitely ""of their time"", making the film itself a curio of the same.I predict that this will be James Cameron's greatest flop, dollar-for-dollar, soundbite-for-soundbite. Don't get carried away by the King Of The World's hype."
"Well I couldn't agree less with what people said about this movie. As a painter, I did enjoy the realistic animation, it was amazing indeed. I could imagine how hard it was to achieve. It definitely pleases the eye.But... yes, there is a BIG but - the story was more than plain. I had that feeling I've seen that movie and I knew exactly what's going to happen - good guy meets a girl, falls in love, betrays her, the bad guys decide it's time to kick some butt, but the good guy gives a powerful speech and everybody goes 'hooray', some of the good guys will die, there will be a final battle between the main hero and the bad guy, well guess who won.. I actually had a bet with a friend on how will the movie end. Anyway, through the whole act, I had the feeling I've written that movie and know exactly how it'll end - and that's not something I want to experience when seeing a movie.So basically I did enjoy the visual effects but the story didn't please me enough to like the movie."
"Seen this the day after it hit USA, I am a big fan of CG anime's and other CG films; Final Fantasy, Vexille, Appleseed. Also video games and such. Never before have I seen such detail in textures and animations in a film like this, it was flawless! This is hands down one of the best films ever conceived in todays technology. Just to explain abit (No Spoilers) about what it looks like, there is next to no difference at all between the cg rendered avatars and the human actors. facial expressions, the lip sync, motor skills and physics. Everything is so well blended you can not help but stare in awe at this movie. So stop reading this, get off your computer chair, grab your keys and get to the movies. This is a must see for anyone!"
"Avatar is a beautiful and amazing movie on humans that set their feet on the planet of other creatures, the na'vi. The story is really gripping and the way the story has been told is award deserving. James Cameron is back with a bang after nearly a decade, and what a jump he has made of genres. From a romantic drama called Titanic, to a pathbreaking cinematic 3D experience called Avatar.While watching this movie, I was so involved with whatever I saw, just like Jake Sully, I started connecting with the world of the Na'vi, and felt anger when the humans starting demolishing it. This is the magic and affect of the storytelling of James Cameron. He uses the complete first hour to make the audience connect and create love for that earth-like world of the Na'vi, the creatures on the planet and the beautiful nature.The way James Cameron has written, handled and directed the story deserves accolades and awards, I have never felt this amazed by a movie before. Performances of the movie are of A+ class quality, even though the movie does not have big names yet, the characterisation of each and every actor is completely in sync with the characters of the movie. Sam Worthington has done a commendable job as Jake Sully, he is very convincing, and has honest expressions. Jake in his Avatar form is absolutely lovable, and has been executed perfectly. Zoe Saldana as Neytiri is beautiful, she truly looks like the princess of the race, and has done a remarkable job. The supporting cast is absolutely wonderful and very impactful.The dosing of humour is perfect, not too much, and not too less of it. The 3D special effects are a milestone in the history of 3D cinematic experiences. Never has any special effect involved me so much. The natural environment looks astonishing and absolutely beautiful, the way production has been designed is very peaceful. The creators of the exterior of this movie have done a commendable job.All in all, I can't describe my feelings for this movie in a review. You have to see this movie with your own eyes, you have to experience it in order to understand what Avatar has to offer. Go watch it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Avatar is quality product in all perspectives, a milestone in the history of cinema. Thumbs up!"
"What else can you say about James Cameron's Avatar than ""wow?"" The visuals are stunning and lead to a feeling of complete immersion incomparable to anything seen in the last decade. Ten years and hundreds of millions of dollars in the making, this film marks a culmination of technologies—the 3D experience and computer generated imagery. The last decade has seen visual effects dominated by computer created phantasmagorias which have led to greater flexibility in terms of directorial license and story-telling possibilities. Shots heretofore unheard of are becoming common-place, as the computer generated world of Pandora clearly demonstrates.Within moments of the opening shot, Avatar makes it clear that this will be a movie where the envelope has not only been pushed, but stamped, put in the mail, and delivered to a zip code on the other side of the galaxy. Minutes into the movie we as viewers are dropped into the jungles of Pandora and land in a quasi-military installation where a vast nameless corporation has set up a group of scientists and mercenaries to quell the native Na'vi. All of this is vast expense is undertaken to mine a mineral of unknown property which nevertheless sells for (presumably) incredible sums. (According to the movie ""twenty-million,"" but with the economy the way it is and inflation over the next hundred and forty years, who knows?)Into this world is thrust our protagonist who is recruited to replace his (deceased) scientist brother on the Avatar Project. This is the brainchild of Dr. Grace Augustine (played by sci-fi legend and Cameron alumna Sigourney Weaver) who wishes to establish a repertoire with the natives by infiltrating their alien culture with artificially grown avatars, combinations of human and Na'vi DNA that look a lot like their human ""drivers,"" but are nevertheless blue skinned and pointy-toothed Na'vi.The plot is pretty straightforward. Good guy discovers an affinity with the natives, uncovers a plot by the evil corporation (in this case their proxy, the mercenary commander played by Stephen Lang), teams up with the bows-and-arrows-wielding natives and through sheer willpower defeats the corporation. Through all of this the viewer is treated to a new world, a wholly invented (and quite inventive) ecology and population rendered in stunning detail that never fails to delight.None of these plot points are particularly novel and the specific details of foreshadowing are blatant enough that a conscientious viewer will at some point realize what will happen in ten or twenty minutes. But the spectacle of it makes these deficiencies less glaring than they could be. In fact, so engrossing is the movie that even when I noticed the narrative problems, I promptly dismissed them so I could settle back into the movie.Of particular interest though, is the way in which humanity is portrayed in this movie. Much ink has been spilled over the imperialist designs on Pandora, and the ham-handed way in which Cameron seems to pursue that theme; often these same complaints are addressed in the same paragraph as the very real criticism that Cameron lacks the characterization and plot depths that would make this a truly epic movie. To address those concerns, as a narrative, this is a plot driven story. That's all. As to the other complaints, a story like this must skimp on developing character in order to further its aim. Would you root for the underdog as heartily by the end if you had grown to love—or at least empathize with—several tangential characters soon to be killed in the uprising? Indeed, once the antagonist has been revealed as less the demon and more a human being driven by impulses and urges and rationalities that perhaps you even agree with, he loses your hatred. Military and political leaders throughout history have known this one simple fact, employed ably by storytellers: You must hate a man to kill him. Or in the case of Avatar, you must hate the antagonist to cheer for the protagonist.Similarly, when examining the anthropomorphous Na'vi I couldn't help but notice the references to the exploitation of the Indigenous American Population by American colonists (of many nationalities) and later the United States. Neither I, nor any of the sons of our fathers, can speak for the intentions of our fathers; we live with the consequences of their actions. Yet, we can learn from them. To this James Cameron seems most intent in the telling of his story. It is, in fact, the central theme.Innately we sense that it is unjust for the powerful to tread upon the powerless; it is a theme that echoes strongly with us, as cruelty seems often to have been perpetrated upon the weaker by the stronger. This feeling of injustice makes it easier to sympathize with, and then cheer for, the Na'vi uprising that eventually ousts humanity from Pandora.It is from this and themes like it that stories derive their power, for stories are the object lessons of morality, teaching us the value of justice, honor, love and hope. More than simply lessons, however, justice triumphing over the wicked, of love and honor victorious against violence and greed are tales which transcend their genre and medium. They resonate throughout history, reminding us of our place in the world, and of our place amongst ourselves. They are the myths that are told around fires, passed from mouth to mouth in an unbroken succession until they become legends placed on canvas screens suddenly rendered in depth by a brush made not of horse or camel hair but the digital wizardry of pixels and bits.But regardless of where and when they are told, it is the skill of the storyteller that paints pictures most vivid in our minds and allows them to transcend the bounds of time and resonate with us again. With Avatar, James Cameron has demonstrated that he is such a storyteller."
"OK, to be honest, when my parents said we were going to see this movie I thought ""Great, another rubbish fantasy movie"".But then I saw the first half an hour, and I was blown away. Sure, the characters are a bit weird, but the special effects were amazing, the story line is clever, the acting was great and it was an action packed, romantic film that suits everyones taste (unless you like horror), and is a great family movie. The only fault is that the movie is a bit to long.I highly recommend watching this movie.9/10 stars"
"I saw this in 3D and this was a first for me. I was a little reluctant with that 3D thing before - with those glasses and all. But after watching the movie i was convinced i had witnessed a technical milestone in movie-making history. Even without 3D this one is breathtaking - and in 3D it is revolutionary. In fact - you have to see the movie to understand this at all. Do yourself a favor. If it is still shown in a theater hear you in 3D - go see it now. Everyone i have talked to who have seen it in 3D have been raving about it. Even those who rarely go to the cinema have been struck by it.The plot has been criticized a bit but i found no problems with it. It is not as deep or broad as, say LOTR, but it is as good as many other classics - like ""Dances With Wolves"", which i think it resembles most. This movie is in my top 3 of all time greatest movies."
"OK I went to see Avatar but I didn't expect what was coming. Story was perfectly executed, visuals simply amazing and I just can't find anything bad about Cameron's latest work. I've found out about it about 6 months back, no I'm not a fanboy. I wasn't particularly hyped neither. Saying that...This is most likely the best movie I've seen in my whole life. It has everything and more. There has to be a continuation, or ideally Cameron should make a trilogy. It's just so good 2 hours 40 minutes spent on watching it felt like an hour. It doesn't matter what movies you like, whether you enjoy watching sci-fi or not - you just need to see it for yourself be it 2 or 3D and you won't believe how good it is."
"I went to see both the IMAX and the non-IMAX 3D versions one after the other today and I say that IMAX 3D is really the best. IMAX is more 3D than the other. It probably is because of the screen size and the projection power. When you are sooo into the movie you forget that you are looking at a screen (the boundaries disappear). In the meeting scene where the Colonel was telling the attendees about the build up of Na'vis, I felt like I was there myself. (This maybe a spoiler alert) Now the movie. After this movie, the movie academy should already add new award categories like Best CGI Character (Male) and Best CGI Character (Female), etc."
"James Cameron's Avatar. Oh the hype, the rumours and the budget.Whilst many saw the dizzying heights Cameron was willing to risk the few of us only saw the inevitable. This film would be a mega blockbuster.But ticket sales alone will not vindicate this movie nor will its budget or any other extravagant claims from Cameron. Truth be told is this film is average at best.For all the bark Cameron makes of making an alien world the use of cgi and humanoid aliens with the pseudo political overtones makes it feel more at home in the star wars universe. The so called groundbreaking effects feel to be in the same vein as new star wars trilogy with a whole world being constructed on the backdrop of green screen and even the movements, colours and gestures seem traceable to those movies. And yet the film has heavy stereotypes of natives like something out of the peter Jackson movies, in an epic 3d landscape with 2d stereotypical portrayals. just about every character in this movie fits the stereotype so much that the plot itself becomes derivative and utterly predictable. So when the preachy new age underlying message tries to appear we are left unmoved and unimpressed. The film itself might as well have been called George Lucas's and Peter Jacksons Avatar in 3d.But people and reviewers are raving about this movie claiming it to be the an artful masterpiece of cinematography. But were you ever in doubt that what you were looking at wasn't real? The CGI still has the unnatural tones and blitzy light so recognisable as computer generated. And the fluid movements and slight gestures still look unconvincing. just look at the earliest use of cgi in the movie for the humans just as the protagonist arrives. It looks nothing more than the opening for a ps3 game. The 3d manifests itself as particles that float between your field of vision rather that of any large moving cgi, this adds more realism and yet it doesn't really justify at revolutionary either based on the scale of its use.And just ask them about the plot and they say the same resounding thing, that it was predicable and then they simply pass that aside.Forgive me for thinking that films with a truly original plot and innovative ideas were what goes into making a good movie. Oh well i suppose because we now have avatar,dancing with wolves isn't as good anymore despite having class acting, beautiful landscapes and a genuinely emotional plot as it lacks cgi, marketing and 3D.But history will ultimately give the final verdict and as technology and cgi improve all you are left with is the story and the idea. And what seems quite clear is that Cameron attempted like many other to push the boundaries and make a foot mark and yet he has not achieved the title first for anything this movie offers.What seems clear from all this is a sad resigning fact of what people expect. They accept the films with no new concepts, big cgi budgets and heavy marketing. They applore the average. Average is indistinct and a waste of time at a running time of over two hours, a mighty one. The people watch what they're told almost to the point of being unthinking for themselves in quality.I would happily accept that it is an average movie but the straw that breaks the camel's back is that it isn't just the masses who support this movie, but even the long time reviewers.It seems everyone has adjusted their bar that much lower and are willing to support the status quo and remain in their comfort zone. The bold and different have been left silenced as the vocal vanguards turn tails.This film is momentous to one horrifically true fact; the stagnation and predictability of Hollywood."
"I think this is the movie i've been waiting for a long time, simply excellent, tech is great, In Avatar, everything feels real – and it's as if you are immersed in the action. And what action. The final battle scene is 20 minutes long and absolutely mind-blowing.The SFX are impeccable and he uses them well. Instead of just shoving them in your face, he weaves them into the story beautifully, and they come off effortlessly. Actors and director's credit, the performances came through extremely well. It's amazing how much of the actors emotions you could see through their Avatar characters. Zoe Saldana gave an especially emotional and strong performance, and you never even saw her real face"
"There's literally no point to watching this movie in the standard 2-D format. The movie is special in 3-D because only then will the audience see all the nuance details and effects that were intended to be experienced by Cameron. The story is nothing special, albeit more realistic since the bad guys aren't really ""bad"" in the traditional Disney movie, cookie cutter sense. There are some environmental issues that one must wrestle with during and after the movie, but perhaps this is not a bad thing. That is not to say the movie's story is bad, it's quite good that I believed in the emotional depth of the characters who were essentially figments of someone else's imagination projected into digital reality. However, it could be better, and improving the content is a task that future filmmakers must face if they are to truly push the frontier. With that said, the main innovation of this movie is the 3-D storytelling which significantly enhances the movie-going experience. In Cameron's other work Titanic, there was a great ""sunset."" With Avatar, I hope this is the ""dawn"" of a new era in cinema."
"this movie is a visual masterpiece. In essence a virtual magic mushroom trip if you have ever seen the allman bros in the beacon theater you will love the colors in this movie , the story was very emotive and there was a lot of subtext that involves our present and past worlds, basically I look at this movie as a message of love,and also as a labor of love .The bar has definitively been raised for other filmmakers , the 3-d is out of this world,the sound and background sounds were unreal and overwhelming , the actors were very well cast and filled their there parts extremely well. I was not disappointed,by anyones performance I consider this my greatest movie going experience And i'm 49 years old and have seen most of the hottest movies"
"What can I say but this movie is AWESOME.Even when there is no action, the story is so good that you will not be bored.The total time of this movie from start to the end with the credits is 3 hours long. Totally worth it.Story of humans trying to take from the natives of the planet, it shows/represents how humans of one race took from the natives of the plant.The only difference is that the mother earth is sentinel and powerful, which represents the natives faith (believes).How one person (in this case was two main characters but also several other small rolls) helps the natives to fight against the more powerful enemies (which were the humans), to me it represents humans helping another.James Cameron's story in this movie touched me emotionally and his directing shows how when one race stands united to fight for what they believe in, it could happen.The story line, action, visual effects, characters, cast chosen, animation as well as the sound effects were all excellent.If I could afford seeing this in the theater everyday, I would.Just like Aliens, Titanic, Terminator and other movies he has written, produced or directed, he was expected be do great with this movie. It is.I wish this movie gets all the nominations and awards in the Oscars. I know I'm being unfair to other movies.His talent is vast and imagination is wicked... I say this as a good thing.Too bad he wasn't the one who directed LOR or HP but I have no complaints about those movies, it was good but imagine if James Cameron and Steven Spielberg combined working on those movies, how would that have come out? I have no complaints about any of those since they are my favorites but this one tops all, even Down Periscope, which neither one of them had any dealings with.I can't wait for the DVD to come out. If I had a dream house and had a huge home movie/entertainment center/room with a home theater wide screen, this movie would be watched everyday and all my children would watch this or made to watch this, hahaha!The story is so great and the message is clear. It describes the human race, how we are and also shows a likeness to how the environment is. We mine for minerals, coal, gold, silver and many other things that is effecting the planet. The natives are shown as to how they live a simpler life and value lives.I also love the way James Cameron brings out the somewhat ancient animals similar to dinosaurs. I highly recommend this movie even to children. There's no violence, just family, friendship, environment and human relationship issues. He also integrated action, adventure, fantasy, science-fiction and romance. What more can one ask of him!"
"Avatar is the best movie ever written, directed. just best film ever shot, the screenplay is just so imaginative, the cinematography is some of the most visually stunning images the eye can see. bottom line is this movie blows all others out of the water, it has the adventure action all the quirky Sci-Fi fantasies that any nerd or non nerd can fall in love with. there is also a little romance that warms the heart, and for a movie that has been in production for nearly or more than seven years, the end product more than exceeds any expectations given. i reiterate my previous statement avatar is absolutely the best movie ever made. now I'm sure there is someone out there who would say that this is a little presumptuous and that I'm following the wind that blows to popular opinion, but no anyone can agree that for a box office budget film this is the best movie ever made. refute this if want for this is an opinion, therefor you cannot. so *#*% You if you try."
"It's hard to review Avatar without reviewing its fandom and its author's actions surrounding it. So I'm not going to try: I will review this movie based on the fact that people consider it to be revolutionary and powerful. Because not only has this movie turned out to be a blockbuster, it has received rave reviews as well. I expected the former and was flabbergasted by the latter.It has all the elements of a good blockbuster: spectacular visual effects, a clear black and white morality, attractive stars and fast paced action. But in my mind it completely misses any qualities that might make it a critical favorite. So why is it anyway? What am I missing? Roger Ebert claims: ""It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message."" Now some people would argue that this message is brought so over the top and corny that it ruins immersion and makes the story too ludicrously black and white. I would go a step further: this has nothing to do with actual environmentalism and pacifism. This is just pretense, symbolical politics that has nothing to do with actual issues.Enviromentalism is not about being against evil corporations, but about offering an alternative and working for that. It is not about ""going back to nature"" but about improving our current society in such a way that it becomes more sustainable. In short: worshiping hunter-gatherer societies is not environmentalism, but escapism. It is refusing to improve your own society and instead idealize another.Pacifism, similarly, is not about fighting with bows and arrows instead of tanks and helicopters. And it is also not about joining a society in which no individualism exists, in which everyone must submit to the greater goal. How is joining the other side in any way connected to anti-war? If this is really meant allegorically, should Western pacifists go to Afghanistan and start killing NATO soldiers? Of course not. Cameron doesn't make his heroes kill the soldiers as a metaphor for killing them in real life, but as a metaphor for ""making them go away"". Oh, wouldn't it be nice if there were no more imperialists? Well, sure. But stopping imperialism by non-violent means is hard and frustrating work, not glorious pwnage. Again, pure escapism. No attempt is made to reflect an actual solution to a problem, but an imaginary totalitarian solution is idealized.Cameron speaking in his imagined language at the Golden Globes was a wake-up call for me. Don't pretend this is anything more than a pipe-dream people. This movie doesn't have a message. It just has an illusionary solution that nobody would want in real life.Once that smokescreen is cleared I hope some people might see the plot for what it is: wafer-thin. We know next to nothing about most main characters, even by the end of this over 2 1/2 hour movie. Why does Jake accept losing his human body and family/friends? How did he really relate to his brother? Why does Michelle Rodriguez' character switch sides? Why are (almost?) all people working for the mining corporation American? Why does Neytiri prefer humans? How does that affect her self-image? How did a young pretender get to run the mining corporation? And why do the Na'vi accept being led by a human? I could go on... for a 3D movie the characters are spectacularly 2-dimensional. One would expect quite a few transformational scenes in a movie about physical transformation: scenes in which different characters mourn the loss of what they leave behind, or curse their dependence on what they're gaining. You know, as happens in almost every episode of say, Scrubs or Lost. It's a cheap trick, but it makes your characters sort of human. And their dilemmas real and insightful. Instead of pure distracting entertainment. If anyone involved accepted that there is no depth to this movie I guess I would give it a 6 or even a 7. As it stands, the pretense of meaning makes the distraction much worse."
"This is my first comment on IMDb. The reason I'm writing this is because I just finished reading a bunch of reviews by people giving this a single star claiming that this movie is terrible and boring. Okay, everyone has their own opinion, but seriously?? Never in my life have I gone to a theater 6 times for a single movie. It is visually outstanding. Cameron just puts you in the heart of Pandora as you are literally living there. The use of 3D just adds magic to the experience; you don't need the typical objects popping in your face to enjoy 3D. Every single detail in this epic is amazing down from the tiny flying insects to the giant flying creatures. Music is breathtaking, gives you a rush at many times. I also actually fell in love with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) as she is without doubt ""man of the match"". Unfortunately Mr. Cameron has ruined it for me, I went to see Sherlock Holmes, good movie BTW, but I just didn't know how to enjoy it. OK, the acting wasn't top-notch; a lot of cheesy lines and of course an unoriginal storyline. But hey, this is sci-fi/ fantasy film. It's supposed to be action packed and visually stunning. That's the point. Go watch the movie as a very entertaining theatrical 3D experience and don't try to look for plot holes and character development. CGI: never witnessed before, STORY: old, but never before told like this, MUSIC: perfect, JAMES CAMERON: fantastic job. With out a doubt, 10/10. Definitely in my top list along with ""The Last Samurai"" - imagine that."
"If you are 10 years old this film will probably move you. If you are older and remember movies like ""Broken Arrow"", ""little Big Man"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""A Man called Horse"", then the plot will seem very familiar to you in fact, slightly hackneyed. It's really cowboys and Indians in space. And let's not forget that most of it is a cartoon.It has massive special effects that are impressive. It has great surround sound. It has 3D. 3D is nice but I don't feel that it has reached it's potential yet. I may be in a minority but so far I find 3 D to be inferior to a well directed well photographed normal film.But if you can get past the plot that is so familiar (to adults) as to remove all suspense from the movie then it will be OK. If you take your children to it I am sure they will enjoy it. And it will be a nice diversion for them for a couple of hours.Is it great movie art? Is it a breakthrough? NO. It's ""ok""."
"Here's my problem with Avatar: I like believable dialogue and originality.First off - don't expect Avatar to be anything you haven't seen before. I've had ""Colors of Wind"" stuck in my head since viewing it last night because it seemed like all the plot points were stolen from Disney's Pocahontas. Simply turning the Indians blue and putting them on a different planet doesn't make it an original concept.Secondly, the dialogue is so riddled with clichés that it was distracting for the first 1.5 hours until the awesome visual effects were able to outweigh the storyline. Calling the Na'vi ""Savages"" and the humans ""Sky-people"" only served to underline the script's banality.This is not even to mention the one dimensional characters like Colonel Quaritch who is so hell-bent on destroying the planet Pandora that he'd sacrifice thousands of soldiers? Not to mention his entire verbal catalog seems taken from Bush platitudes: ""Shock and Awe"", ""Pre-emptive strike"", ""Fight terror with terror."" This movie kept me engaged and was definitely a step above the average action-adventure blockbuster. However, don't be fooled into thinking it's anything more than that."
"I know this review is kinda late. I watched this in 3D at cinemas and later in Blu-ray's etc. It has to be one of the best uses of HD tech in the history of movies. The story is believable the characters are so real and let's face it relatable. It goes beyond story telling. The sounds and sights (I just wish we had the smells lol). If you haven't seen it, then trust me take a few hours you time. Book front room telly (hopefully with a sound bar or surround sound) plenty of nibbles. Sit back. Enjoy 👍🏼"
"I saw the movie in 3D. It was a night I was very sad because of bad family news, I was doubtful if to use the long time booked tickets. I have to say that during the movie I completely forgot all my troubles, I was in another world, much better then the real one, full of magic things and landscapes. This movie for me is a fantastic journey, that let your heart flight free in your child's fantasy. I think Cameron and his staff have done a fantastic job, writing a new page in movie history. I don't care the plot is not new, I like if good wins over the evil, but this is a true masterpiece, the future of movie will change. The 3D in the future could be improved."
"I went to see Avatar this afternoon in 3d, and I must say; it was simply one of the most mind-blowing experiences I've ever been subjected to. The special effects were completely out of this world, and the attention to detail was astounding. Pandora is absolutely beautiful and it's crazy to understand that someone had the imagination to create such out-of-this-world imagery. The story-line was strong, and the characters where easily relate-able. What I believe to be, completely original piece of film-making, and a template for many movies to come. The three hours weren't a drag either, I was never bored. Fantastic Performances by Sam Worthington and Zoe Salander as well as an impressive supporting role performance from Giovanni Ribisi I suppose there's nothing more I can say thank to tell you to watch it and see it for yourselves!"
"It's a pretty risky bet but for me is the best film at the visual of the story so far, has set a precedent setting a new level of credibility in the sense of reality and naturalness of 3D being capable of displaying a digital reality as credible as the reality of the real world but there are also limitations that are apparent when the amount of digital creations screen is very high producing some CGIs little expressive and replicated, a perfectly logical thing on the other hand in a technology that has just taken off and the he still has much to develop to get to graze their limitations, the spectacular contrasts found in the faces and amazingly realistic foregrounds. I can not believe how people gives 1 point of qualification. Have seen the movie?"
"The truth is the bad reviewers of this film, on IMDb, try to pin Avatar to some other movie saying it isn't original. Well I ask, if it isn't original then why cant you place it on one movie. The truth is the Movie Avatar is a mixture of Aliens, Terminator, Titanic, Ferngully(its not a bad thing) and Pocahontas. Not Dances with wolves(beyond boring movie) like so many people have said.Avatar doesn't gross 300 million Dollars in one weekend and then another 300 million the next because its an ""ok film"" its a master piece and James Cameron knows it.I only had one gripe with one character the mining operation leader.10/10 Its a movie you shouldn't miss."
"A while back while watching the teaser trailer of the movie, I started to wonder what the hell it was. I immediately jumped on the ""I hate Avatar"" bandwagon even though I wasn't aware of the story.Fastforward to the present day. The only reason I watched the movie was because I have not watched a 3D movie before. I was pleasantly surprised & came out wanting to watch the movie again & again.As the other comments have said, this movie is an experience. It has a little of everything & you experience everything between laughter & sorrow, hope & despair, love & loss. I believe in the movie so much that I had to write a review (my first ever)."
"I would like to ask a question: is there someone in the audience who witnessed the first coming of 3D in the sixties? I would really like to read some reactions from adults back then. (Not just for the sake of comparisons, technological or others. I am not even sure if it is cultural the same way, cultural differences aside.)It surely is sweeping. It is mind-numbing in a way, or more ways if you will. Yet the audience reacted in a strange way, I mean the audience from Athens, Greece, where I saw the film, 3D and all, and this is what I would like to share, since everybody will make his own experience on watching the film, and then will react to the reviews. So, this is it: let's say that the film risks to get short-circuited into an allegory of a choice between the ""real"" and a virtual reality, with the hero switching between ""bodies"", like in a game, as some detractors would probably say. My question was: when the point comes, for it was galloping towards us in the climax, will the hero choose his invalid body and thus validate his existence as a hero, or regress to the virtual realm and as such deliver us to the deadlock of a fantasy world? Although this remains unresolved in a way at the end, even titillating us with the promise of a sequel, and here I go back to the bizarre reaction from the audience, are we sure we want to go to the end of our fantasy world? It surely is entertaining, but is it all the way?When Neytiri saves Jake Sully from suffocation, and they, then, just before the end, meet for the first time ""as they really are"", the audience burst out laughing, as if this was gruesome and incongruous for the sake of the love story. As if everything else in the story could be awesome, or agenda-ridden, but not what happens between a male and a female, even though, well, they are of a different species. It reminded me of a TV ad that appeared some years now - girl wanders in the woods, encounters a frog, kisses frog, frog becomes prince, prince looks somewhat dubiously girl, kisses girl, girl becomes beer, he drinks beer. You guessed it, the ad was for a beer. So, the question I would like to pose is: what does a beer taste like on Pandora, is the gist of the film?Please tell me.Open my eyes."
"Sometimes I think people really do just believe and go along with the hype of whatever they are being sold. The truth is that this movie is boring, long, totally unoriginal and easily forgettable (thank goodness). The visual 3D effects were quite spectacular but only for about 10 minutes. After that, they became repetitive and therefore lost any appeal. The voices were irritating, the message tiresome and the plot silly. The story is an poor imitation of FernGully The last Rainforest and Pocahontas. There is nothing original in the story and it it just drags on and on and on. There is nothing more to add about this film other than I really did not like it."
"Just a quick preface and caveat before continuing. I am NOT giving this a rating of ten for great story, script writing or acting (farrrrrr from it). I'm simply giving Avatar a ten for no other reason than it will be remembered as the 3D film that launched a new era in cinematography and movie making. That's it. Too much carping from the Cannes Film Festival crowd about it being crap because of it's shallow storyline (wading pool shallow, actually) and being a rehash of a classic theme (which it is). Really guys......do you go to a Spielberg or Cameron movie for depth? Even their attempts at serious stuff turns predictably melodramatic and overripe regardless how naturally serious the original material might be (Titanic, Shindler's list, Munich......etc.). For goodness sake, don't go to see these guys' work for anything more than sheer FANTASTIC (not to be believed, literally and figuratively) entertainment and an affective purge (have a good cry and heart thump).Now to business. The plot line is blatantly simplistic, yet classic: foreigner meets primitives, ulterior motives, love affair with chief's daughter (sleeping dictionary / Dances with Wolves themes), then betrayal, epiphany, motives change to altruistic, rescue of primitives, becomes one with the primitives.....you know the drill. Any other movie and that would be the ""mother of all spoilers"", but for this eye candy of a presentation the story is almost irrelevant.However, despite the predictable plot and storyline, this visual banquet has to be seen to be believed. I don't think I'll be able to watch a TV or DVD / Blue ray rerun without 3D enhancement technology. I guess that's the whole point: get us hooked on this stuff (no comparison to flat lander cinema for action movies) and then bring on the 3D TVs / Blue Rays / AV / etc. Lastly, 3D may inevitably be prerequisite for superior action and sci fi cinema, as well as sports, but it will NEVER replace or usurp the fundamentals of good movie making and acting. Personally, I don't want to see ANY of the classics remade in 3D (I didn't even like colorization......more like ""bastardization""). 3D is just a cool tool; that's all. So you puritans out there......just relax! See a good proctologist, lay down, roll over and say AHHHH! He'll have that CFF corn cob out of there in no time. Then you can enjoy life again. P.S. that last bit with the hanging O2 mask and last grasp / gasp scene was just way too ""Spielberg"" for this kid. That kind of stuff doesn't make my heart pound, it makes my blood boil."
"The effects are pretty decent. This is 3d done right, no scaring the audiences with sudden jabs and scares. This is 3d simply done right and that's it.I suspect that James got lost in his love for his 3d toys that he simply closed shut Pandora's story box. And same goes for characterization, two of my most beloved treasures of a movie. Both, the story and characterization are pretty weak. Who is Jake as a person. Who is Colonel miles and why cant he find a shirt with sleeves in an air conditioned facility? So many unanswered questions, so much of lost potential. James, you started out well, with the whole Avatar /gaming/ concept, but lost the mojo quite early.The acting is uninspiring. I don't even think anybody even tried.Attempt to make Zoe's avatar attractive does work some times, reminds me of Angelina Jolie's flirtatious fish avatar Lola in Shark Tale .One easy story flaw was that when the Colonel shoots the choppers they are bullet proof but arrows go right thru??!! And whats up with Zoe's aviator flying goggles, they actually have glass/plastic lenses in them!!! Way to go for a civilization which has not even figured how to cook the food they eat!!!Avatar almost felt like Kaena redone on a handsome budget.One small question that remained unanswered by me was how was the avatar connected to the human body? Was there a wireless link? And then the next level, how was the avatar powered? Kind of important questions, especially if you think of body/avatar swaps that happen towards the end.This movie was OK fun for first time viewing. Did actually enjoy the effects and the 3d but I will not watch it again. Sorry James, this might break a lot of movie records, but, for me, it can never sink to Titanic heights!2012 remains as the undefeated special effects movie champion of 2009 for me.______________________Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.* Shorter and crisper storyline, this film goes on and on (at least it shouldn't seems that way) * Get rid of the tails on the Navi, I guess its a matter of personal choice, I am not much if a tail person (at least not on humanoids) * Get rid of the flying mountains thingy (No crouching tiger, No hidden dragon and No flying mountain) * Somehow, in our fictional worlds, we always tend to associate technological advancement with evolution of intelligence of a species. The Navi, without a single iPod to their credit, are hence shown as simple folks. I would depict them with greater levels of intelligence in a more Yoda like wiseness who simply chose not to pursue technology.This entire review was originally posted on my movie review blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/avatar.html"
A truly brilliant film making success that has set an entirely new level for films across the planet. The 3D experience was truly inspiring and has set a new benchmark for other film makers across the globe. Others have now changed their plans and tried to put their films into a 3D quality but it can never really match it. Stephen Lang should have won the Oscar for for best supporting actor and Zoe Saldana should have won best actress. The academy have really lost the plot this time. This is the Best Motion Picture not only this year but for the past decade. The Hurt Locker got the sympathy vote because it made next to nothing.
"The last time I thought a movie deserved a 10 star rating was "" The Color Purple ""; unfortunately we've had a plethora of bad to mediocre movies that have been made recently. Avatar takes the spotlight for excellence, innovation, creativity, character design and a legion of other qualities. The thing I noticed most about Avatar is the beautiful graphics the attention to detail; I also noticed with sheer awe is how well the actors and actresses acted out their part. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana were absolutely spellbinding in their roles; Zoe Saldana made me look at her acting ability in a different light with her playing Neytiri. She played a very compassionate, and mundane role in the movie so well that she should be awarded an Oscar along with Sam Worthington. Everyone played out their part awesomely; Avatar is easily one of the best movies made in the history of cinema. James Cameron is an absolute genius at work people; I look forward to similar quality movies made by this man."
"Lord I miss the Last Air bender....James Cameron's half a BILLION dollar film (figure in the promotion its around that figure) is a huge animated film masquerading as a live action feature film. Its, like most of Cameron's super productions, a self serving over hyped monstrosity that is neither as good as he thinks it is or as bad as we hoped it would be.Billed as the next step in entertainment I'm left wondering what makes the film different then anything thats gone before other than the motion capture characters. The Next step? only if you go to the movie on rare occasions and never read fantasy or Science Fiction. Ursula Le Guin, Piers Anthony, EE Doc Smith and everyone else working in genre has been there before. Is it really worth the effort to count down the long list of films this borrows from Quigley Down Under to A Man Called Horse to the Matrix to Aliens to Dances with Wolves to anything I've read people have compared it to. Its a plot as well worn as they come. Even the music is lifted from tribal chants to Star Trek The Motion Picture to anything with soaring choral music. Its's also clear Wayne Barlowe designed the look of the creatures since they seem similar to numerous creatures he's painted over the years.(Had they wanted to be radical they would have had Barlowe go off the board) Okay I could go on ripping the film to shreds but lets try and take it on its own terms.Lets say it, the film is neither original nor ground breaking. Its an over hyped film that is much too in love itself. It is painfully overlong at seventeen...er almost three hours.The plot has a cripple ex-marine taking his twin brothers place as an avatar pilot on a distant world. He is assigned to infiltrate the locals and find out as much as he can. he does so and in the process falls in love with the people and one girl in particular. He then has to fight with his new people to save them and their way of life.On the most basic of levels the plot is fine but on a detailed level there are lots of plot holes and plot questions. Thankfully Cameron in his wonderful junior high school way has set up outs for many things that don't make sense like how will the good guys win when they have bows and arrows and the humans have explosives and bullets.( Cameron is not a stupid man as anyone who has heard him talk or seen his documentaries can attest, however his story construction has always been stunted and simplistic at best) How the simplicity will survive in two planned sequels is beyond me.There are lots of long ""look isn't this great"" sequences which are meant to show off. On the plus side they look good in 2D on the down side the film slows way down as a result.The performances are fine but out side of the main two characters everyone is cardboard. Its fine because they aren't given much to really do but at the same time they all blur together.The action scenes are good but not great with many of the oh cool sequences in the TV commercials. Also some sequences seem stretched out for no good reason with lots of slow motion to make everything look ""Cool"".In all honesty had this film lost an hour it would have been a much better film, but at two hours forty something minutes this film is a soul killer. My Dad and I just looked at each other at about the half way point an wondered how much longer this had to go and we both groaned when we realized it was almost it was eighty something minutes.Its not a bad film. Its worth seeing, but I don't know that I needed to see it on a big screen, and while I didn't see it in 3D I don't think I really would have liked it more if I had. Personally I think you can wait for DVD or cable.(A friend of a a friend who didn't like the film said that he now understands how people who don't get Star Wars feel. Frankly there is a difference. Love of Star Wars comes from a real place, a place that wasn't mass media created. All of the hype to Avatar is PR created hype put together to sell tickets. Star Wars is a film that is about characters moving in a simplistic story where things just are, the worlds of Luke Skywalker were not pushed in our faces until the marketing machines took over with Return of the Jedi and by that time the characters and the story had taken hold because they were good. Avatar is a simple story pumped up to sell tickets and sell toys.Its had the marketing machine from the first moment.. Star Wars has been out for almost 33 years, spawned 6 films, numerous novels, comics and TV shows. Avatar has been out a week and has spawned little more than some mixed box office and a budget debt bigger than many countries GNP. I'll wait 33 Years before I assess how successful Avatar is.) 6 out of 10"
"i hate this movie its a ripoff ofFernGully, aliens, Dances with Wolves, The last samurai, Pocahontas, Last of the Dogmen, the Mini Series SHOGUN, and The Emerald Foresti can't believe how much movies these days use CGI i hate it it's stupid it takes you right out of the movie its like seeing the boom mike in shot it ruins the hole movie for me.and for a sci fi movie its weak it never mentions how the starship is supposed to work or the avatar pods in Any detail.and i don't like movies that try to demonize technology and progress as if we'ed all be better of in the wiled, like living past 30 keeping are teeth and knowing a thing or two about the universe is unnatural."
"Yes, the story may be predictable, yes, the message may be predictable so if you are one of those people looking for a picture ""with depth"" this may not be the movie for you. If you want ""drama"" and well developed ""dramatis personae"" then stay home. This movie is for Trekkies, and Star Wars, Blade Runner fans. In other words, this is for the person who wants to be entertained. For the person who wants to see amazing graphics and action. For the person who wants to escape for almost three hours from the daily grind of daily life. I went to see this with my family and thought that it was and amazing blend of CG graphics and action and adventure. I was able to spend the time imagining living in another world far from the crap we have here nowadays. I recommend going to see it in 3D and I could only imagine what it may have looked like in Imax but since we don't have one of those near by then I'll settle for the ""standard"". But yes, if you enjoy wallowing in in ""drama"" save you money and stay home and watch reruns of ER or Hill Street Blues or whatever, but if you just want to have fun then for Pete's sake go watch this thing it WAS GREAT!"
"I've experienced Avatar in a local theater in Amsterdam with IMAX and I must say that this movie is one of the best movies ever made. I've never experienced all the human emotions in one movie, this movie made me happy when I was drawn into Avatars world, I mean I would wanna live there and never come back to the real world. In the first scene of the 3D world of Avatar the blue species girl's first line is genius with so much emotion and so powerful. The actors did an outstanding job with convincing me why the Avatar is the most special thing ever. Mr Cameron best work,the movie is about 3 hours long, but it felt like one minute, if you can take me in one breath, this director did it. It's outstandingly perfect, and all the emotion's crying, happiness, anger, depression, feeling real love from the screen this MOVIE comes in with a BANG!"
"Saw it on opening night in IMAX 3D. Best experience of my life. It isn't just a movie you really feel like you have entered an entire new and better world. Maybe the best movie I have ever seen and God I have seen a lot. Definitely the best visual effects ever!!!! A little bit of crumby dialog but other than that the whole thing is a TEN. This movie has everything great acting, story, action, and effects. You must see this movie in theaters preferably in IMAX. The creation of the Na'vi is amazing above all the other things. I wish I were one of them. And an amazing love story also completes the film so everyone who goes will be satisfied. Yes, the story is one that we have heard before and is really nothing new but, it is a story we love and is told in a whole new way. Avatar is doing right now what Star Wars did for its time. This is an epic. If you would like to talk to me about my review send me an email at uwanttoknome@aim.com"
"This is the first movie I remember feeling like I felt after reading a good sci-fi fantasy book; I didn't want it to end and was sad it was over. A good book does that, but I've never had a movie do that for me, and I've seen a good deal of movies...As the saying goes, there are only 9 plots in existence, so I am not upset by any overlaps with other movies I've watched in the past that have similar plot elements. I did find myself caring about the main characters, and while the similarities to native American movies (as mentioned in other posts, Dances with Wolves) is not surprising considering the type of characters in the movie and the motivations of the foreign invaders, the sci-fi element of a neurally connected planet was an intriguing plot element.As in all sci-fi, you need to put your present-life science knowledge in your back pocket, and assume Clarke's Three Laws of Prediction:1) When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.2) The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.3) Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.I liked this better than Star Wars, and I grew up watching those movies when they came out. But perhaps that is because nothing as involving as the original trilogy has been released since they first came out! I loved the Lord of the Rings, but it didn't make me feel this way when all was said and done..."
"How should I start?First my Kudos to one and only creator God James Cameron.It was a mind blowing film I ever saw in my life and I am sure this will be the only movie worth watch for everyone in their lifetime.From the starting to ending we will be spellbound with this beautiful world.The theme of bonding,the bird rides, the prayers for spirits and what not everything made my hair go goosebumps.Who is saying there is lack of emotion,every frame has a emotion that will tie you till end,that is why we are this much involved.I think every human who saw this movie will pray to be in Pandora for a day in his life,as I am now.This movie has given life to the characters ,usually it is vice-versa,right:No one can ask more than that.This film has a soul so complete that you yourself go in that.I thought like I will write so much, but here I am wordless ,but everyone just go and see the movie ,not for the big budget sake,not for our very own James Cameron , but to fulfill your fantasy world more than you can imagine.After I came from the movie my heart is so heavy with happiness I can bare,Thank you so much James Cameron from my bottom of the heart."
"I had a considerable amount of reservation in m y mind before going to this movie. The cause consisted in enough good movies this year already (the same District 9 etc.) and thought that it might very well be another kind of a Terminator 4 like CG movie with no real spark behind or worse yet - some kind of 2012 (sorry - this is a failed movie despite the spectacular effects). I had it before entering the cinema and exactly before the movie started. Then it all disappeared. It got me sooo much that I watched it twice in the theater, ad perhaps will go to watch some more.Another one of those few that should never be forgotten. Spectacular, out of the box thinking, super 3d stunning sound.I would tend to think this one is the winner of all times.Thank you James."
"Wow! My wife and I just saw Avatar last night and we were both blown away! We chose to pay the extra money and see it in 3D and it was worth every penny. I was concerned at first, because all of the 3D trailers (and there were a bunch) looked cheesy and a bit unclear, but the opening scene, in the ship, took my breath away and it stayed that way throughout the entire movie. The visual effects were so stunning, they could have easily overshadowed the story and plot, but as amazing as they were, they still took a back seat to this story of good vs evil. During the movie, I became so caught up in the characters, I truly cared what happened to them and how it would end. I am a sci-fi fan, but I almost chose to see a different movie, because I thought the trailers had given away the plot and I didn't see myself enjoying a bunch of thin, blue giants. Luckily, I know not to judge a book by its cover. My wife, who hates sci-fi, may have liked the movie even more than me. She talked about how great it was all night. I'm usually very critical of everything, but there is not one thing I would change about this movie, well one thing...I wish it would have been 4 hours long."
"I went to see the 3D version of the movie last night with my son. We both were awestruck at the visuals. I would give this movie high marks on just that alone. I have read many other reviews on this and people have been nay saying about the plot and character development. I did not see a problem with either. I really felt connected to the main character and his struggle to pick sides. I also felt for the indigenous people for their plight. There is plenty of story telling where you get to know more about the Na'vi culture. There is talk about how earth is in the future and why the humans are there on Pandora. Some of the story telling is subtle, but it is all there. I left the theater thrilled and will go see this again. It is hands down, the best movie of the year and I recommend it to anyone who can sit in a theater chair for two and a half hours."
"I was extremely disappointed with this film. I should have known by the way people talked about the ""looks"" instead of the plot. Imagine this film without CGI and it probably would be just another Saturday morning cartoon. If they had to use old-school costumes and make-up this thing would have fallen flat.The target audience seemed to be the kids who watch Saturday morning cartoons. The story line would only challenge the brain of a 6 year old.But let's cut straight to the heart of the matter: the CGI. OK, so the computer can create some neat images. Got it. But I find beauty more in the Discovery channel's ""Life"" and ""Planet Earth"" then in this movie. For example, the characters walk like those in Sim Life - jerky. The characters were nowhere close to the ""alive"" imagery of Toy Story.The beasts with the thick-skin were just another mutant thing and the ""horses"" were blocky and weak. The flying birds were the only exception to nice flow and appearance in my eye.And consider the way the final fight scene showed a robot (think Iron Man) that moved better than a human being can...all by a joystick. The thing weighs tons but moved like a ballerina. Please! When it reached above its head to grab the main character I started laughing...don't tell me the thing has eyes on the top of its head or a brain to operate it. Sad.Scene after scene was met with a furrowed brow. We have Weaver's avatar looking like a poorly animated Tomb Raider. We have Weaver wrapped in green vegetation (when, how and why left unanswered). We have futuristic helicopters (sort of) but old-school wheelchairs.We have a smelly alien somehow getting in good with the planet's inhabitants. And not just fitting in, but moving up the ranks to one of the top leadership position.We have a red bird (the rest are green-blue) that didn't pick him, broke the rule of ""only one bird"" and I'm not sure that was enough to convince the people that this fainting stranger could now lead 2,000 to victory.We have sleep pods that have a big red button on them, but in the future we obviously can't shut them down any other way. We have helicopters that can leave a military installation (with big doors) without resistance and without any pursuit.We have a big tree as the home that is destroyed and THEN we discover other clans exist and don't live in trees. Do they hook up their ponytails to the water, grass, or clouds? The race comes across as passive since they sat around and waited to be over-ran, yet every scene of the daughter's suitor indicated warriors. At the beginning they were feared for their size and poisoned arrows, but by the end the wooden sticks were laughed at. Which is it? Seriously, this was a cartoon. And had I sat down one Saturday morning to watch it with my nephews I would have wondered when it was going to end. Yuck."
After all the hype and praise from all my friends and movie critics I saw it in the movie theater. I didn't see it in 3d but even if I did it would have still been the same crappy movie.After the first hour of sitting through the movie I started to think is it going to get better. It never did. The one thing that really made me angry was the blue chick that kept screaming at Sam Worthington. She made me wan't to pull my hair out. If i had to say something good about this movie i would have to say the cgi was pretty amazing and the last battle scene was also pretty OK.If you haven't seen it yet then i prefer you don't.
"i went to see this in 3d at my local cinema and i was blown away by the quality of the film i had seen a couple of film in 3d before but they were just little bit of 3d thrown into a 2d film whereas this was all 3d and was amazing i would go see it again..The story is a classic romance but with robots,guns and massive blue people its a very well written and superbly directed film the cgi was amazing..The cast are amazing with Sam Worthington leading the line up in his new found stardom with a line of film hoping to have him on board and i can see why he is amazing in this film and its nice to see sigourney weaver back in big films after my previous favourite film being aliens..A Must See!!!!!! 10/10"
"I loved Avatar. It was many different kinds of movies blended into one. There was love, unity, a love of nature, sorrow, happiness, honor, spirituality, and much more. I loved watching this movie. It was very well done. I would guess that a director's wish for viewers to leave the theaters wishing they were in a reality of the movie they just watched. Avatar was certainly a movie that could accomplish that. The movie inspired great emotion and was revolutionary on how people could think of our world and lives. The movie was unique in a brilliant way to say the least. I didn't watch it in IMAX but I certainly would like to after watching it the first time. Even though it's still in theaters I wish it was out on DVD since I can't experience that ""part of the movie reality"" life. =(. Basically, I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone and everyone."
"Avatar is a HUUUUGE wow... stunning, spectacular and the cinematic experience of the new generation. It's once in a life time experience and a film which would change the way movies are made forever. Kudos to the master James Cameron for bringing us this visually stunning treat. It is a film meant to be seen in 3D and multiple times. One time viewing is not enough to absorb all the details and visuals shown. The visual effects are eye-popping and jaw-dropping. Though story could have been a little better. Given that Cameron is master of sequel (T2) I would be anxiously waiting for a sequel. Also given the magnificent place Pandora is, it needs another film to be discovered fully."
"Goodness me! Once again James Cameron takes mediocrity to new heights. He places the mediocrity in a box made of gold and elevates the box onto a platform with spotlights pointing at it. Goodness me! He destroyed the Alien franchise with his trashy and brash sequel and then he turned a real sea tragedy into a cliché ridden, money spinning bore fest(Titanic). Goodness me! It seems that any project with his name attached is bound for sure fire success because it's James 'Goodness Me' Cameron and we must, by law, consider his works genius. (Goodness me).Avatar is a computer game. Nothing more. I want to see a MOVIE when I go to the cinema, thank you very much and a big Goodness Me!I shall now declare a national holiday. I shall call it 'Goodness Me Day' in honour of James Cameron."
"***Spoilers ahead*** I was having a pretty lousy day when I entered the cinema yesterday. And despite James Cameron being one of my favorite directors and Aliens being one of my absolute favorite movies of all time, I was not sure about Avatar. The criticism has been about the story so naturally I was worried that this one would be all fluff but no substance. After having seen the film I can gladly report that is not the case, rather I would say the story and its themes is one of the stronger points about the movie, not considering the fantastic special effects.It seems unnecessary to recap the story since I'm sure you've all heard it a thousand times by now. To point out a few things about it that no one seems to have talked about I would think is a better thing. All of James Cameron's movies are in some way about dreams. He frequently uses his personal dreams as inspiration for his films, perhaps most famously the idea for the Terminator which he got from a fever dream. This motif is used to its fullest extent in Avatar, where Jake Sully's journeys with his avatar body are like dreams from which he has to wake up. It all takes a fascinating meta-level when you think about our mediated world today and how many things we do just to get away from our real lives: Playing video games, drinking alcohol and of course - going to the movies. The very final scene of the movie is a clear nod to this notion. One could view Jake Sully's very physical disability as an analogy to any sort of disability or disadvantage that would keep a person from doing what they want. In the dream world that Jake flees to he has everything he ever wanted; Adventure, a beautiful potential love interest, ""people"" or rather Na'vi who care about him and so on. In the grey, cold and lifeless world he comes from, he is just ""meat on wheels""; A nobody.The movie actually leaves you with a bitter sweet feeling. Nobody's existence on this planet can be as wonderful as living on Pandora, much like Jake Sully you don't want to ""wake up"", but after 166 minutes you have no choice. Thank God you have the option of seeing the film again which I will do for sure, wallet-raping ticket prices for the 3D version or not. It certainly is worth it.People think the characters are thin and the story is clichéd and predictable, but I could not agree less on all points. To me it seems like a conspiracy, an attempt to bring the film down. I've seen a lot of movies in my days but most of the time I could not predict what was going to happen. The critics seem to be mistaking narrative means of telling a story with clichés. More than anything, the use of familiar themes and shapes for the animals and so on, is a sign of good storytelling by letting the audience recognize the familiar and thereby relate to the film on another level.In the above tirade about Avatar's story I have not said much about the special effects in the film which of course are outstanding, but they are very seldom there as anything more than a means to an end, just like in any good science fiction film. The same goes for the 3D, they are never just a gimmick where they point something straight into your face, it's just there to add to the whole experience. Avatar is far from a perfect movie, you could easily cut about 30 minutes out of the film and still tell the same story, and some moments are cringe-worthy. But as an experience, which to me is what movies ultimately are about, there is simply nothing that compares to Avatar."
"I have to say, it hurts me to see this movie so high in the top 100, higher than The Matrix, 2001, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and many many other movies that actually had something new to offer other than special effects.Now I can understand why people are blown away by the special effects in this movie. Everything looks just great, there has been a lot of attention to detail, and the 3D is not the annoying in-your-face kind of 3D that some other movies have. It's more of a subtle kind of 3D, enough to have its effect, but not constantly screaming ""LOOK, I'M A 3D MOVIE!!""Sadly, this is the only subtle thing about the movie. Cameron has a message for us, one that is very important, and it had better be clear, otherwise we might misunderstand. The message is this: humans are evil. And by god, let's use every single cliché we can think of to make this as clear as possible. We have a bunch of evil scientists who care about nothing but money, another scientist who tries to convince them that they are wrong but no one listens to, a soldier who is sent to learn the unfamiliar and oh-so non-human species from the inside to provide information to the evil scientists but becomes attached to them, and the list goes on.Let's discuss the script some more. The main character is Jake Sully, a marine who is in a wheelchair but he wants to go to Pandora anyway and gets permission because... well because this is Hollywood, and we need our main character to be an outcast. His twin brother, who ""was always the scientist"" just died (something that doesn't seem to bother him much) and he now has to take his place to use an Avatar body to explore Pandora, regardless that he has no experience whatsoever, because he is the only one with the same DNA. By all means let us not have a main character who actually knows what the hell he's doing. Evil Colonel Quaritch blackmails him into becoming his personal spy, saying he'll make sure Jake gets his legs back if he provides him with a lot of information about the oh-so non-human people on Pandora. Jake gets lost in the forest on his first day and ends up with one of the blue creatures, Neytiri, who appears to hate him but takes him to their home anyway. Now this couldn't possibly lead to a romance, could it? The blue people (I forgot what they are called, but they're so similar to humans that you may as well call them people) normally hate the Sky People, as they call the humans (and yet they all go to some school one of the scientists made to learn English - how does that work anyway? There are some humans who speak their language, and some of them speak English, but how did they learn this providing that they are from other planets and the blue ones don't want to have anything to do with the white ones?) but they are willing to accept Jake to be taught their ways by Neytiri, so that he can become one of them. He sees this as a great opportunity to gain information about them to tell the Evil Colonel. Once again, I wonder what this could lead to.One of the most annoying things about the movie is the main character himself, Jake. He has this extremely irritating ""oh, look, I don't know anything about their culture, so why don't I make this as clear as possible instead of shutting up and trying to understand them?"" attitude, along with zero personality. In fact, if you expect any of the characters to have any personality at all, you'd better drop that expectation right here and now. Stereotypes all the way.The sad thing is that James Cameron isn't just out to make money. This ain't Michael Bay. Cameron is a man with a huge passion for film. He would sell his soul if that was the only way he could keep making films and I respect him for that. The only problem is that, beyond the looks, he's just not good at it. Cameron, by all means keep making films, but please, just get someone else to write the script in the future."
Avatar is worth seeing on the big screens.This film is actually worth reviewing. A great movie to watch with your family or friends on the big screens. Acting and writing was great as well as the visuals and audio even on my home system. It has great message which has made it my favorite film I suppose. I can say I will be rewatching this.
"Seriously... seriously people. To say the movie stinks or the story isn't original.... seriously, that's why you're giving it a 1? How many movies have non original stories and we still watch them and enjoy them. Yes the idea of the story in itself has been told many times, but when it has been told it's normally been met with approval (dances with wolves, last samurai, Pocahontas, etc etc etc), but the world that James Cameron has created is incredible. It's not my favorite movie but it definitely gets undeserved hate from people that have jumped on the anti avatar bandwagon. Just appreciate it for what it is. A retelling of a story that we all know and have seen before in a completely original world. Ya the story is predictable... so what. It's visually incredible. Don't be swayed by band wagon haters. It's the keyboard hero culture that we now live in."
"As people have already said, it's visually one of the best movies ever created. It definitely gets a 10/10 in that department. (Fantastic) I won't lie by saying I enjoyed this movie as a popcorn flick, however, how it unfolds the plot was where it suffered. There seems to be underdeveloped parts to the movie that keeps it from being a modern classic. The ending especially feels forced to create political propaganda about the Native Americans. So a 4/10 for the plot. (Weak) Overall, this could've been the best movie we've all seen in years but unfortunately, the plot keeps it from getting that title. It gets a 7/10 for my rating. (Good)"
"James Cameron's long-awaited Avatar turns out to be a flimsy excuse for some spectacular, yet empty posturing in never-before-seen 3D. The technological innovations will keep you interested for about an half hour, then the apparent flaws start to take over the viewing experience.Dialogue is, as might be expected, sub-par. Lead performances by Worthington and Saldana are flat and uninvolving. Script is laden with all the clichés Cameron could muster, and filled to the brim with unnecessary hand-holding of the viewer. Every conceivable aspect is over-thoroughly explained through dialogue, making for a totally unbelievable interaction between characters and world, and also giving the impression Cameron thinks I'm an idiot. So-called green and anti- colonial values are glued-on-top, and are completely unconvincing. Film is thin in every aspect except the 3D-visuals. As it turns out, the ""Indians"" are once again saved by White Male. Even the indigenous Na'vi are modeled after conservative human stereotypes. Female lead is in the end only there to be the romantic interest, the gender-models of the Na'vi mirror those old ""truth's"": women are emotional an effeminate, men are strong and masculine. Here Cameron affirms conservative stereotypes by giving them an intergalactic justification ""in natural order of things"".The film has been receiving raving reviews from mainstream critics, and is sure to be an international hit. This doesn't bode well for the future of Hollywood cinema. Up next: Transformers 3D!"
"Someone in my household rented Avatar by James Cameron for $1 via Red Box DVD.Reluctantly, I watched this piece of liberal, tree-hugging subversive, propaganda. I cannot believe that this is the biggest grossing motion picture of all time and that it was nominated for (and won) a plethora of awards.Here's the deal in a nutshell: All Americans/white people are evil and native peoples are good, noble, peaceful, and in tune with nature. Got it?The climactic battle is intended to bring the audience to cheer for those enemies killing US Marines and the traitorous humans who are helping them. Uhhh... go Taliban?The tired, Liberal story of the evil white devils losing their souls as they rape and plunder an innocent world for its mineral wealth is about as cutting edge as a dull baby spoon.And, even as these anti-American propaganda films go, this one is particularly poorly written, directed, acted, and the CGI is unremarkable as well. James Cameron has sunk to a new low - even for James Cameron.The names of things in the movie and the ridiculously transparent ""symbolism"" would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetically treasonous in a time of war.Planet: ""Pandora"" (or ""Pandorum"" - whatever). Are you kidding me? Boy, we opened a real Pandora's box here... Please! Mineral being sought: ""Unobtainium"". Really? So, we are supposed to be surprised when it turns out to be... unobtainable?I could go on with the Pentagon-shaped emblems and Human compound, but I just don't feel like it.Anti-Hero Jake Sully is supposed to be a disabled US Marine but they got the cardboard Sam Worthington to pay him without even the effort of trying to cover his British accent. The cartoon-like ""Kill 'em All"" Marine Colonel Quaritch is played with somnambulism by the obviously Soap-Opera-trained Stephen Lang. It appears he spent all of his prep time in the gym, because it sure wasn't on acting. The greedy corporate stereotype Parker Selfridge (Selfish?!?!) was phoned in by the usually talented Giovanni Ribisi. These actors should be ashamed of themselves. I know: ""Crying all the way to the bank."" But would you betray your country for thirty pieces of silver (even at today's prices)? Oh, that's right: Worthington isn't American, so he doesn't give a rat's rear-end that people will cheer for dead US Marines.Let me guess: This movie was written by brace-faced teenage girls in the Mall, right? If you are a real American, and claim to ""support our troops,"" you would be well-advised to stay away from this movie and anything Cameron does from this point forward. He is a Left- wing traitor to his country and is not even very good at that."
"Avatar is a quintessential example of style over substance. There's nothing wrong with style and imagination, especially when Cameron does such a fine job of it. Avatar is a feast for the senses, overwhelming the viewer with a fully immersive, completely imagined world. It is a truly impressive achievement and sets the benchmark for all future movie worlds. (BTW, we didn't see the problems some other reviewers described in 3D theaters; our image was MOST impressive.)But...someone really needs to teach Cameron how to write dialog! Terminator and Aliens were better than his later efforts, most likely due to co-writers Gail Ann Hurd and David Giler. Unfortunately, Avatar suffers from simplistic plot devices and truly juvenile dialog that really left us cold. (JuJuBees? Unobtanium? - GMAB!) And while we know this movie is fiction, the visuals were good enough that they demanded a consistent ecosystem and evolution, at least for us. The 'floating mountains' and the English-speaking natives didn't bother us all that much; at least there was an attempt at explanation (large 'Unobtainium' deposits, the scientists' native school). But we really had a hard time with some of the biology. For example, why did the Na'vi, Banshee and Leonopteryx evolve with two arms (wings) and two legs while the Direhorse, Viperwolf, Hammerhead and many other creatures have four forelegs and two rears? That makes absolutely NO evolutionary sense and bothered us almost as much as the weak plot. With a little more work (and a little less hubris) Avatar could have been so much more. Unfortunately, it is truly stunning wrapping paper surrounding a rather disappointing gift."
"I rated Pocahontas 7. Wonderful songs, beautiful artwork and captivating voice actors with clear environmental message.Avatar is just a simple pretty movie for kids. Its PG. And perhaps that is why it lacks philosophical subtext, true romance or any plot twists. The movie is not ""bad"". Like 'Finding Nemo' or 'Fern Gully', the high contrast vivid colours of Pandora are pretty to look at. The levitating rocks of Pandora ensure no scene is scoffed at by the viewer as ""implausible"".Yet, like many older viewers, I find it lacking.1. No plot twists of any kind. No subplots even. Jake arrives. Jake learns to be Navi while not revealing what will happen to last minute. Jake betrays military commander to help save Navi. The End.2. The military white guys lose to the ""natives"".Its frustrating that despite giving him 3 months, and many ""warning shots"", the white military is portrayed as the bad guys.3. Firepower? The military's futuristic ""advanced"" technology defeated by bow and arrow? No radar? No smart guns? How about some actual armour? --spoiler-- The ending is sort anti-climactic. Jake as the Avatar leads neighbouring tribes to their quick and pointless deaths - yet this is portrayed as a happy ending. Avatar suggests that ""soft military"" presence and diplomacy are flawed. Only aggressive attacks work.4. What is the point of the Avatars? The Navi immediately know Jake is not real Navi. Either way the Navi don't trust outsiders. Why the deception? Wouldn't human contact be simpler. Would also perhaps allow at least 1 hr for negotiations instead of 3 months of vine swinging.5. Navi never know WHY they are being attacked. Jake never explains and neither does Grace. Only that ""they are coming"". Hundreds of years into the future no technology to dig under HomeTree? How about other deposits? I just find it difficult to imagine mankind beginning right away with deforestation on Pandora after leaving a desolate Earth devoid of plant life."
"This was nothing more than a nice looking film. The plot has been done 1,000's of times. The dialogue is something out of the 50's or 60's and the characters are not interesting in the least, cardboard cutouts. I was expecting something like this but didn't expect it to be this bad. Basically its for children. Bad guys infiltrate aliens in avatars that look exactly like them, big and blue with mostly human qualities.The humans want the world they live in because it has something valuable in the ground. Anyway the undercover humans begin to have empathy and feelings for the aliens and help defend their world against the big bad humans. And thats a wrap! Really,there's not much more to it."
"This is such a perfect example of a film where the director/writer is absolute horrible, and the visual effects guys are insanely good. There is nothing beyond this movie than the special effects. The people that do not see this are either stupid, blinded by the effects or simply in denial. To rate this movie good got NOTHING to do with taste what so ever, but is simply wrong. WRONG. These movies were good in an early period(at the beginning), but its now become too many of them, and the originality in these sci-fi films is no longer existent. Yes, the message of the movie is good. But its old. Any clever kid understood the greediness of the human species beforehand. And if you needed a movie to enlighten that, than you're not more clever than a 10 year old. Sorry to say.It starts of with our main character, Jake. We get a quick intro about his prehistory and why he is sent to where he is sent, and thats about all of character development and description we get of this guy. I cant feel him at all. I never did. He is sent to a new world and there he must learn from the inside. Inside from a tribe that got their homeland on an area where there is some sort of rock that is highly valuable. Then this bad guy comes up. Oh My GOD. What a stereotype. This type of characters 10 years old can create. Same goes with the script.He falls in love with a girl(Oh gosh please) and the world. He fights against the ""evil"" and they win. The end. I knew this ending would happen 15 minutes into the film. What a flop. I cant understand it got nominated for best pictures and best director at the Oscars."
"Just got back from my second viewing of Avatar in the stunning imax 3D and it was even better this time around. I wont go into the storyline as you probably already have an idea of this and i don't want to add any spoilers. The storyline itself is simple but not unintelligent and keeps you gripped from start to finish. There is lots of action, battle scenes, sci fi, and a love story to keep you occupied. The special effects are amazing and the attention to detail is brilliant but this is not just a fx showpiece like 2012 was, there is depth to avatar. I just could not see how anyone could dislike this, the 2 and a half hours drifted by and left me wanting more. James Cameron truly is a master of movies. Perfect movie."
"I am in awe of this movie's sumptuous feast of colour and imagery! The storyline of the characters are predictable, I don't mind though. The CGI and 3D make up for anything else that you might want to 'whinge' or complain about.My son is 17 and unfortunately did not see this in 3D which affected his review. He said it was so-so on the storyline. He usually loves this kind of movie, so I was surprised. Meanwhile, he will be sent back to see it again with his big brother and change his review! The 3D version has gorgeous and believable depth, you'll see all plant life, creations & machinery you haven't seen in a movie before,too. All in sharp 3D. It's done in the way that it isn't cheesy and corny. (Remember Jaws & Friday 13 in 3D? ugh). The vegetation, animals & material things are jutting out suddenly or floating around subtly. You do feel like you are part of the movie, nicely done I think. After awhile, you are aware of the little pieces of this and that around in 3D and ooh and ah at it quietly, really. (We could hear ourselves and people around us, respectively doing this.No one was disruptive or acting like idiots in the audience, not one peep! I think everyone was humbled to experience this incredible CGI creativity. I was sad ;o) when it reverted back to human form throughout, I just wanted to see the CGI all the time! No Jar Jar Binks & Gollum in this movie. 100 times better than that, too.I love futuristic movies, this one is up there with the best. Yes the US marines are stereotyped in this movie, oh well, too bad. They serve a purpose. There are environmental, corporate, moral, ethical and tolerance messages throughout this movie.This is a keeper and I believe one of the best, visually stunning movies ever made. How James Cameron made his people steam train forward with his vision is incredible. I look forward to many more movies made like this one, not necessarily alien / futuristic. This will surely bring people back to the good old cinema.This should / must win all the awards for art direction, editing. I wonder how pain staking some of this was to make? I love Star Wars & Lord of the Rings, but this movie tops both of them for the breakthrough imagery on screen. So enjoyable. I think we will see it again maybe at the Sydney IMAX.Do not dare to cheap out and download this, people!!! You will not regret seeing it - on the bigger screen the better!! On another note, I can't believe our local little town cinema did not install the Dolby 3D equipment (they said would cost $200k). If not now, but also for the future of movies going forward. The lady at the cinema told me, ""oh, there are only a few scenes with 3D"" BullS@#&%!!!! We went in town and saw it in 3D, thankfully.So summarizing, ahh... $16 AUD well spent, I'd spend another.. will the eventual DVD come with those 3D glasses? I hope so!! Go see it before you are the last one and everyone has finished talking to death about it, will ya? Cheers to James Cameron. I give it a 300 million (cost to make it) thumbs up!!!"
"I simply don't have the words because none of those in the title of this review even remotely covers the total amazement that this movie gave me.Admittedly, my husband and I saw this in 3D so it took on a reality that it couldn't otherwise.Honestly, I've never had a reaction to a movie like I did this one. It did more than set me on the edge of my seat.I found myself alternately laughing, crying, cheering, and even shaking in anticipation with each new moment in the movie.I do have to say that it did take about a half hour or so to get into but after that, the world just disappeared around me.There are some definite societal overtones to this movie. It quickly became apparent that this was a social statement about what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans arrived on the continent. But its a statement that honestly cannot be overdone, as its happened to other society's too.The lesson is to learn from history, something that few seem to have done. If we cannot learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it, even if its to an alien race over a century in the future.Be that as it may, the story was still captivating.And rather than taking away from the movie, I found the CGI simply adding to it.It was so real. There are times I caught myself flinching as a stray ash or leaf moved through the image. Like I could reach out and touch what I was seeing.Simply and utterly incredible.James Cameron truly has a masterpiece unlike any I've ever seen. I only hope he gets his due at the awards shows this year, but somehow I doubt it. The awards shows never give it to anyone that actually deserves it when they actually deserve it."
"The marines and humans are the new world coming over to America (Pandora) and the aliens are the Native Americans (using bows and arrows against steal and guns). The main character befriends the daughter of the chief and in the end fights against his own people along side of the Native Americans (aliens). James Cameron has literally created a new medium. The complete integration of CGI with real life. using as much data from both worlds at the same time.Also, did anyone notice that he broke the animation realness curve? As you approach hyper real with a human in CGI, it begins to look worse. James Cameron was able to assemble together enough techs and artists to break that curve and create realistic humans that don't look ""odd"". Remember all those terrible parts in the new Star Wars films where you can immediately tell that it was a CG character? (like Darth Maul jumping and doing a back flip when Qui-Gon says ""Anakin, get down!""There was NONE of that in this movie, it looked so natural. I can't believe they filmed it in a gym, with no sets?!?! (i mean obviously there were some sets, but whatever.)11 out of 10, this movie breaks ground, smashes open a cavernous gap in reality and releases 10,000 Buddha natures onto the world."
"Wow. Just got back from seeing Avatar in IMAX 3D, and it was incredible - it truly lives up to the hype. I was quite skeptical going in - I saw the early reviews here on IMDb, and was wondering if much of the hype could be coming from paid marketing shills.But, that is not the case. Its just a fantastic movie.I'm pretty jaded - I usually don't feel very satisfied with most movies. But this one was different. It felt like it lasted an eternity - but in a good way. It was as if you were there with Jake for the whole three months he spent with the Na'vi.By the way, the IMAX 3D was expensive, but it was worth it in this case if only for the sound and the high quality screen. I'm now curious how it looks in 2D.Don't miss this one."
"I wont go into plot details, I will just tell you my feelings about this film, because it is so powerful I wanted to share this. I have now seen this film twice. The 1st time I saw it I rang my eldest son he asked me what I thought of it, I see many films love the cinema, my response was simple, It was the greatest film I have ever seen. He saw it the next day, I asked him what he thought he said the same. The 3d is stunning the story while simple is emotive during the film you are fully engrossed by the characters and their inter-relationships, it fully captivated me. I am going to see it for a 3rd time at the IMAX. My only fear is that I now expect even more from my cinematic experiences in the future. This is a classic and another brilliant film from Mr Cameron"
"Avatar is the new feat of film-making. I would never have though James Cameron would have been able to pull this off, especially after all the hype. It's safe to say he did. While the plot is similar to other films, and despite many reviews saying that it's screenplay does not hold up to the weight of everything else in the film, I disagree. It's true that the screenplay is simple, but I found that is was a lot better than Titanic's screenplay, which really turned me off. But like most said, the screenplay is the least important aspect in this film, in a good way. It sets off this whole new vision that Cameron wants to bring to us. He does magnificently. The creature designs, visuals, sound, colors, and depth that everything has in Pandora is amazing, and I have never been transported into another world like I have with Avatar. Seeing it in 3-D was spectacular, simply spellbinding, and unforgettable. Everyone in the theater was in complete amazement at everything in this film, and for that, James Cameron has succeeded very well. He is a great director, and I hope he gets nominated for the Oscar at the very least. Avatar is the new feat of visual entertainment. It is one of the best films of 2009, and one of the best action films ever made."
"I went to the cinema not really sure if I was going to like this. I was worried that I'd spend the (almost) three hours wanting to do anything but watch this, and did not expect to have a new favourite film by the end of it.The effects, as you can expect, were the best I've ever seen ever; it was almost better than reality. We were on a new planet 'Pandora' and it was all so real. There were new animals, aliens, and plants and no matter how illogical they were they were still made believable with all of the cinematography.The storyline wasn't the best ever but it was still made great by the feelings that the audience had from the characters, and the question of 'who is morally right?' The 3D wasn't as good as the quality of the effects, but it wasn't worth complaining about because this was one of the best films I'd seen in my life. This was a visual masterpiece. Watch it while it's still in cinemas to see a film at its best."
"This was the best movie I have ever seen, by far.If you like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings you will be thrilled by this one.The first time I sat with tears in my eyes during three quarters of the time.This is a classic. And the current rate people are giving it is far to low.It's way above Shawshank Redemption (which is also one of my favorites).True is doesn't have much room actors finesse. The film is just to fast and overwhelming to blend in much subtle play. But anyone knowledgeable on politics and the few cultures still living on our planet in conjunction with nature will recognize and appreciate all kind of stuff, like the way the Pandorians greet each other, woven into the story."
"Let me start by saying i went to see this movie in 3D which i would say made a huge difference. You need to go see this movie in 3D version while it's in theaters, no exceptions. The Movie has a good story line and it was action packed. Visually this movie is mind blowing and you will feel like you on a drug minus the negative effects drugs have. I am not promoting drug use or nor have I've done drugs and just using as an metaphor to describe how trippy you feel. You kind of feel you are really there in outer space and your actually in the forest with these vibrant colors. I am glad my gf assisted a pond me going. It's a good movie despite the so-so or weak movies that are currently out. I believe this film with have the same branding style that the matrix had, because before both films we never saw nothing with a signature like it before. I don't want to give anything away ...i just want to say bravo to everyone that worked on putting this together..well worth my 14 dollars"
"This is perhaps the finest movies ever made... I was glued to my seat throughout the movie... Every thing was perfect about the movie - the breadth-taking graphics, the acting, the script and the most appreciating part was the movie's Direction James Cameroon had set the bar and raised it to such an extent that is difficult (if not impossible) for others to achieve Terminator, Titanic and now Avatar.. they'll be movies that'll be known for a very long timeThe 3D version was simply amazing... The sound effects and cinematography was class apartI am going to watch this movie one more time.... and of course in 3D again :)"
"Simply put: You have to see it to believe it!!! Fantastic, well worth 10 out of 10.I saw this movie on Christmas Eve as a friend recommended it to me. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best Sci/Fi Action movie in the past 5 years. Cameron managed to create a completely self-contained world which is 100% believable and emotionally involving.The only weak side of the movie was the story, which could have been developed better. The story was, in essence, a moral tale for a younger audience; I guess it was a trade-off for the filmmakers. Despite this, the movie it thoroughly enjoyable, engaging and, above all, believable."
"In my opinion this is the best film in existence, i saw it in 3d and the scenery is incredible, you feel as if you are really in the jungle. The action was great, it was pacey, and had a good romance story through it as well.Cameron does an excellent job of making you sympathise with the aliens and disdain the humans. The acting was not the best feature but it was still good, especially sam worthington, who i thought was the ownly positive to come out of terminator salvation. Some people complained about things not being explained but these were events that occurred before the movie and are unimportantIts hard to put into words really, just go see it!"
"Avatar is a visual poem. It is not the story, but the way it is told that makes you feel what the director felt and let you have a beautiful experience. Even the critics reckon that the visual experience is extraordinary and this can not be told. It must be seen in a cinema, and best in the company your loved ones.One can say that La Traviata has a poor, predictable story about a man and an ill women that can not be together. But if you know the story, you will not go to see it? Everything must be an epic today and we can not see lyric movies? When the starting speech of the colonel is pus out of focus, we are warned by Jack that we should not let our minds at ease and try to move out of the comfort of everyday speeches that tell us what to do. If you do this, you will the same beautiful experience that I did and enjoy the eye-opening final. Walt Disney's Snow White is released on Blu-ray 70+ years after it was created even if everybody knows the story, so we can also feel good when Neytiri wakes Jake with a kiss. You must stop worrying about world or galaxy politics and economics and enjoy simple emotions. Fortunately, the director made this very easy and only the ones wondering if Snow White will get a divorce will not be able to feel the simple joy of flying free or the joy of walking barefoot into Pandora's forest.You have to see it in 3D to fully understand what a great job James Cameron has done as a director. He is not showing off the technology like most in the industry now, but he understood that filming in a virtual environment he can do with the camera things that are impossible in the real world. So you will feel like you are running in the forest with the action, you will feel like flying with the action and you almost feel the smell of the forest. He understood also that 3D is not like the real world or a hologram, where the focus is where you set your eyes to look, and he used the focus combined with 3D in a creative way. And what a marvelous result! Thank you James Cameron for getting us a glimpse of what the holodeck must be feeling!"
"I went to see this film with very high expectations. As I sat in the theater I thought to myself, 'well, now I'm going to watch a masterpiece.' With such high expectations, you'd think I was going to be easily disappointed, but I wasn't. This film fulfilled my highest expectations. I've got friends who've gone all intellectual and muttered about the shallow characters and weak script, but as far as I'm concerned they're the ones who are losing out. If you go to watch this movie, just immerse yourself in the spectacle and enjoy the ride. It's spectacular. I didn't have any problems at all with the story line. It made me think of the old colonial days and what has been going down for centuries in the name of business. To have such a visually spectacular piece of art with such a noble message is a double blessing. Don't ruin it with your cynicism. Just enjoy it. I'll be going to see it again."
"There is only one word to describe this movie....BRILLIANT..This movie will blow your mind..The story is nothing too original but the overall style of presentation and story telling coupled with beautiful CGI work is just amazing,this is a movie worth watching over and over again. James Cameron has just shown the world he's a genius. This movie is the best movie of the year and it will go down in history as a cinematic masterpiece. Hope to see Avatar made into a trilogy and I hope to see it quite soon. This movie is movie magic at its best.go watch it you won't regret it :D"
"Just seen the movie..wow what a movie!! Every frame depicts the hard work of each n every technician behind it Though the story line of the movie is predictable..Cameron shows us Every scene like never before!! Most of the part is been picturized in the dream world ""Pandora"" The chemistry between Cast of this movie Sam Worthington,Zoe Saldana worked out perfectly!! The creatures of the Pandora planet were designed well and one can observe the creativity of technicians Action scenes were absolutely stunning and amazing undoubtedly and yeah i have to search the dictionary to praise this movie!! and i'll bet..This movie will be the best Sci-Fi flicks ever made..Although movie got hype before the release..it had satisfied audience with the ultimate taking Finally,Hats Off to Cameron and believe me this is the best bet this week!!And what are you looking for?rush into your nearest theatres and enjoy the thrill of the 'A V A T A R'....The movie will be better experienced in 3D..go and enjoy it!!"
"After going off the face of the earth for over twelve years, James Cameron, one of the great directors of our time, has risen from the ashes victoriously. The CGI is magnificent, and is no doubt the best I've ever seen since Peter Jackson blew the world's mind with his ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"". The motion capture on the actors' bodies looks so real, that it took me to another dimension, almost another world. This grandeur was not only captured through the character animation, but also with the different CGI location shots of the different creatures, the forest, the trees, and the whole world he has created. This world reminded me very much of the 1992 release of ""Ferngully"", but in 3-D. Now regarding the plot, it is James Cameron simplicity-a paraplegic soldier (Sam Worthington) is given the opportunity to take in part of a mission on the planet Pandora. There, he learns that a greedy corporation intends to drive out the planet's inhabitants, the Na'vi, so to retrieve millions of dollars worth of minerals. In exchange for a spinal surgery that'll fix his legs, he gathers information for a military unit, led by a bloodthirsty Colonel (Stephen Lang) while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an ""avatar"" identity. As time passes and tension increases between the Na'vi and the humans, he is drawn between his orders and what he desires. The plot sounds simple enough, yet I can't help but notice all of the undertones that James Cameron throws into his film. Without giving too much more of the story away, it made me think of how the U.S. government bullies people into what they want, particularly with the Iraq War, which is a fight over oil, at the cost of innocent Iraqi lives. I don't know if this was Cameron's intent, but this movie gives a pale reflection of our modern government and big corporations. It also reflects on our issue with planet life. Cameron paints the marines as bloodthirsty villains who lust for destruction, but the Na'vi on the other hand, are deep lovers of nature and peace. This reminds me very much of the cowboy and Indian scenario depicted graphically in films such as ""Little Big Man"" and ""Dances with Wolves"", the white man's inability to make peace with both nature and different races. The Na'vi themselves remind me much of the Native Americans, despite the fact they're blue with pointy ears, and with golden eyes.Overall, there is much to look forward to in ""Avatar"", and not just in the visual effects department. The actors all did a great job but I don't expect any of them to be nominated for an Oscar. On a personal note though, Stephen Lang as the gung-ho Colonel and Sigourney Weaver as the peace loving Scientist gave the best performances, and not because both are at the opposite ends of the spectrum, but with the fact they immersed themselves deeply into their characters so magically. And for a 162-minute film, it flies by. There's no way you can be bored with this movie. James Cameron has once again made another excellent film that I'll declare as 2009's best film, and I'm considering in adding ""Avatar"" on my personal favorite list of movies. This movie has everything, effects (both visually and emotionally), believable characters, an interesting plot, and a fast pace. And trust me, at the end of the movie, you'll be cheering for the Na'vi."
"I went to the opening night at the cinema to watch this and it was packed. Going in with the expectation that it may be all hype and i would be disappointed but, I wasn't The 3D experience was great, there was a good character base, a theme of action, adventure, love and sci fi all rolled into one.The whole movie was flawless and it didn't feel like it dragged on or you couldn't wait for the ending, instead you liked the characters, you loved the Navai and you enjoyed the scope of the movie.I give the movie a 10 because it was colourful, it was different, it had plot and i enjoyed it.Well worth the wait."
"SEE IT - AVATAR lives up to the expectations for visual innovation that were promised. This is truly a spellbinding experience, with a storyline and character development that are were just right to support the stunning visual panoramas that the mind will struggle to absorb. Director Cameron has beautifully woven social, spiritual, environmental, technological, and personal threads into the action scenes that are presented using tiny delicate creatures and majestic landscapes to grab the audience throughout the entire movie.It is one of those experiences that should be enjoyed for a second time, I know I will"
"I just registered in IMDb to give a 10 for this movie. I have already watched it twice and will continue to watch till its played. This is no longer a movie, its something which human race has to treasure till its extinction. Kudos to James Cameroon, He is a god. Avatar from now onwards is a part of my life. If you haven't watched yet, please go and watch it. You will do yourselves a great favor. I am dying to know how Jim's dreams are going to be. I have never even dreamed something close to Avatar in my whole life!! The casting is just right, everyone does their part well. Thanks to technology for realizing this dream of Jim. Thanks one and all for giving this generation a movie going experience which they will cherish for their life."
"Is there any creativity left in Hollywood? This movie is like a collection of clichés we've seen over and over again. It is pure escapism and nothing more.Why would we focus on earth when we have this blue planet where we can simply start over again. So far the idea of the movie add some battle sequences and a few million dollar special effects and you have yourself a blockbuster.What I really don't understand is why the na'vi people are almost exactly like the native Americans. I think you would at least try to cover up that the movie is just like ""Dances with wolves"". Except the character development and engaging story of course. A good film if you have some time to kill and don't want to think to much. Butt I cant help thinking it could have been so much better with some more creativity and thought."
"Finally,yesterday night I got the opportunity to watch Avatar in the Imax 3d.After watching the movie, i can aver that it is the best-of- decade.Great acting,magnum opus visual effects and excellent screen play and direction to perfection has made Avatar one the best movies ever made on the silver screen.i don't want to reveal story content but i can say that Avatar has got every thing to spellbind you.Go and watch avatar and locate yourself in the world of Pandora.Watch Avatar only in 3d because the special effects are so good that you won't believe your eyes.At last, i want to say a big thanks to JAMES CAMERON for giving us the movie AVATAR."
"this will be short and simple...there is much room for expansion on this epic as it exists now, which i think should be done. The current production, as it stands doesn't even seem as long as it is and there is so much room for expansion. The ideas and visuals that are breached here are only the start...The ore still exists and the 'humans' have been shown opposition...i sense a sequel that could be as good or better than the first... Some of the reviews that i read spoke of weak character development, false, and only strong visuals...and in response i say archetypes...as stories...I think that some story lines are so timeless that the environment makes them omnipotent. With the birth of a new world, with new humanoid creatures, only new opportunities arise. this story line could go to the ends of Pandora for the focus that Avatar was devised from initially...mineral. i am anxious to see where this goes..."
"Even critics of action and science fiction movies would be hard pressed to not like this film. The story line is not exceptional but the message is a powerful one, perfect for anyone who cares about the environment, and for young people who may not have strong awareness of what corporations and governments can do to people and the environment for the sake of profit. The battle to save Pandora and its life forms translates to our very own planet. It is a humane and emotional story about a soldier who comes to understand what his employers are about to do. I applaud Cameron for giving this film some depth to compliment to powerful special effects.Only see this film in 3-D. It is a remarkable technical achievement as it takes us into another world full of natural wonders and nature based inhabitants. The entire film in it's 3-D glory is engrossing, from the fancy technology of the invaders, to the beauty of the Pandora environment."
"Avatar may be the greatest film out to date, the animation and cinematics are outstanding, the visual image of the world in which avatar is set is imaginative and visually stunning, with a combination of action, adventure and a truly gripping story, this film turned out to be great.I spent extra money to watch it in an imax theatre because i knew it would not disappoint , with the extra dimension, the amazing sound and picture quality it was far superior to any film i have seen before.This is why avatar for me is a 10/10 excellent movie, film of the year, hopefully movie producers will be looking to beat the bench mark that avatar has set and produce some interesting propositions in the future.thank you"
"The shear amount of technology that went into this film is enough to put anyone at awe. I was drawn into these computer generated characters more so than any other movie that I've seen before. Definitely hit every emotion between me and my daughter who also has turned into an 'Avatar' fan. A must watch. I will see this one again! Worth the movie theater price. From the beginning, you are introduced to a world, much similar to our living rain forests. My daughter and I began to correlate the similarities between the Avatar world and ours. The 3d experience puts you right in the middle, literally, enhancing the realistic cinematics in the movie. Take your older kids (10+). A few violent scenes and some interesting grown up innuendos."
"Why I say that? Let's see: First the story was simple. No big twists, no million story-lines, no needless happenings. No too much love and no incompetent characters. No cool heroes, no bitch-like girls for show. And no airy, flippant characters for bringing boring jokes and making the movie awkward.Second the CGI is masterful and it is through the entire movie not just for some big scenes. From the first leaf to the last water drop, all exist. When a plane crashing to the trees, when the birds flying over the water, it really happens, you don't feel it's just CGI. Amazing.The clichés? Well, there are elements in the movie we already saw in other movies, but who cares? We already saw Titanic before Cameron's version, and we saw movies about prisoners before Shawshank Redemption. If somebody shots a good photo of a sunset, nobody should shot sunsets ever more? I don't care about clichés when they are in perfect balance with the other components of the movie.Overall, this movie is well balanced with good characters, a unique CGI and unique way it brings the well known message about protecting your environment. (10 is for perfect not just excellent.)"
"I've always loved fairy tales ... however never have I expected to be actually able to take a part in one ... for almost 3 hours James has managed to transport me to unbelievable land of adventure, a love tale, using a simple storyline with powerful message, and even more powerful visual experience.Trust me this is not what I've expected today when I joined the waiting line, which was spiralling snake like around the block of downtown IMAX theatre ...folks if you knew me you'd know that I never write reviews, especially movie reviews ... but this had to be exception ...today the rules have changed ...for all movie goers this move is about to change our movie experience. Well done JC ...can't wait to see AVATAR 2, 3 ..."
"HooYeah!!! Indeed a supreme film. Excellently done by Mr. Cameron. If anyone can describe it, then TRY it. For I can not do so. I watched the whole movie with a lot of popcorn and lemon juice. The acting, casting, surrounding all are flawless.In my eyes this could be the movie of the year. The story is a very good one too. I see some big follow ups of this kinda movies. Let us all hope for more of these kinda movies to come in 2k10. I watched the whole movie with a lot of popcorn and lemon juice. If you don't have anything to do then go watch this awesome movie. It will help you to have more movie fun to make it trough the day. Take a lot of food with you when you go.TIP: >Just see the movie.<"
"Just a quickie, i'm not going to drone on, this was brilliant, BRILLIANT. This is entertainment friends, exciting, action packed, engaging, romantic, funny, its report card is all As, it passed every class. The story alone is timely and relevant, it demands consideration of its issues from even the most passive viewer. Add to that the jaw dislocating effects and top it off with great actors doing their best work and Jimbo's done it again.Is this worth my Pounds, Dollars, whatever ? wholeheartedly YES, even if your not normally a sci-fi kind of soul, its much more than that, see it 3D, see it Imax, just see it, it really is that good."
"Its basically the visuals. I could see why this film took 12 years to make. The plot is relatively simple. Its like the good conquistador and the natives just before the rest of the Spanish arrive and rape, pillage, plunder, except the natives are blue not brown and the Spanish are Earthlings. The visual effects are crazy son! Its an entirely lifelike world created in a desktop. There's a detailed explanation to every fictitious wildlife. However watching this you realize that the imagination is only limited to whatever we see. Everything in the film comes from something we have seen before. Native tribes, tigers, rhinos, lemurs, horses, wolves and giant birds. 12 years of work went into it so the hype didn't fail. One thing. This movie is called Avatar, a word from Hindu mythology, did it have anything to do with it? Possibly, because there were BLUE PEOPLE in the movie!"
"As always for James Cameron movies, this has been an extremely well-researched one. I am a sci-fi & science fan, and a researcher by profession. Good sci-fi movies intrigue me. But in recent times it seemed that directors & writers had lost ideas. The last real good ones I watched were the Matrix and the Terminator(s). Since then it has been suffocating years of crappy sci-fi concepts in movies. ""Avatar"" feels like a fresh new breeze. Besides all the excellent special effects, the concepts are very well-grounded from a scientific perspective. I like the way Cameron has fantasized of establishing direct neural connection between organisms, and the depicted ""soul"" as information content in neural networks. If one has read scientific articles on possibilities of extraterrestrial life forms and how evolution can create & mold life under bizarre environments, one would readily be able to appreciate the life-form designs & concepts in the movie. Hat's off to James Cameron - looking forward to the sequels."
"I didn't expect too much about this movie, simply because i really hate the previous film made by James Cameron (you know which one), but then i remembered what i felt when i watch The Abyss and Terminator 2; so i said ""why not?"". And you know what? I spend the most entertaining 150 minutes in a long time; WHY?, Just because James Cameron made a cinematic masterpiece and created a world that breathes and shine with its own sun. It simply blew me away. Avatar it's a film so full of details, colors and life that just watching the gorgeous and magnificent landscapes is worth the money that you pay for your ticket. For all the detractors of this film, i just can say that just time will give this film the place it deserves in the history of cinema. I could write lines and lines worshiping AVATAR, but i just wanted to share my opinion about it, and widely recommend it to every person who wants to be amazed and behold the talent of a true master. I can assure you that you won't regret it.....Ricardo Gomez Veracruz, Mexico"
James Cameron cannot compare to legendary director Joe Dante. The blue aliens of this movie feel like nothing but a cheap imitation of the gremlins from Gremlins 2 The New Batch. The CGI was subpar and could not compare to the special effects of Gremlins 2 The New Batch. The ending was predictable and I feel like this movie just copied its name from the shoe Avatar The Last Airbender to get more viewers. This movie was not a masterpiece but a speck of dust in the mountain that is Gremlins 2 The New Batch.
"The title of the movie is in papyrus, they literally clicked on the font button in word and chose papyrus"
"Don't know if someone else has mentioned this, but even if someone has, it deserves many more mentions. Alan Dean Foster, sci-fi author, wrote a book in 1975 called Midworld, about a rain forest planet which is being exploited by an evil corporation. The natives live in a symbiotic relationship to their surroundings and live in a huge tree called the Home Tree. They communicate telepathically with animals. Seriously...Google it. There's way more similarities. Plus, Cameron has used Foster to write the novel version of his movie Aliens, so we know Cameron was familiar with Foster's work. James Cameron is a plagiarist and should give credit where credit is due. Plus his movie is a rip off of Dances With Wolves, and it looks like a CGI cartoon made by SyFy network. You suck Cameron!"
"The first time I saw the trailer for this movie I was immediately interested. And this movie exceeded my expectations. With a story that is easy to understand but very intriguing. Plus stunning image results and the results were very mature CGI. Plus a very skilled actor playing a character each. At the end of the story I never thought that Jake Sully would be like ""that"". Avatar (2009) is the best movie I've ever seen overall. Neither of stories, pictures, and characters. Very amazing."
"I saw it. I bowed down to the hype and went and saw the mighty Avatar in 3D IMAX. I am supposed to like this movie, right? Well, the first hour was great, the 3D effects were very trippy and the film contained the only convincing CGI I have ever seen. Up until now I have found CGI, for the most part, laughable. Once I got used to the 3D- and the hardcore corniness kicks in, I found the film almost unbearable. I know Cameron is making a film to appeal to the lowest common denominator- but some of that dialog was inexcusably bad. Sure, dumb it down for the masses- but not that far down! The repeated love affirmation ""I see you"" being an example. I'm guessing he had to use terms a simpleton would use because he was already counting his dollars as knew he would eventually have to dub the movie in every real language out there. Another complaint: Even though the supposed bad guys in the movie were American military and mercenaries- I still thought they managed to glorify imperialist violence with all the ""kick-ass"" bravado and the subtle inspirational music during attack on the big tree. I'm sure most kids and meat-heads in the audience were thinking ""yeah, burn that hippie tree down and its kill those Blue Man Group kooks."" Also, I can't help but wonder if people truly enjoyed the barrage of quantum psycho-babble that infected the movie like a virus. I admit that Sigourney Weavers little speech to Giovanni Ribisi about the network of energy being alive was mildly interesting- especially when found in a blockbuster. But were people really feeling the Na'vi's cross-legged arm to arm spiritual rejuvenation dance? I found it silly. I did enjoy exploring the Na'vi world and of course the psychedelic colors of the forest and dragons were amazing to look at. But as the minutes worn on and it became yet another hour long good vs. evil battle sequence I had had enough. Been there, done that, don't need to see it again. But the nail in the coffin of me basically disliking the film was the god-awful saintly forest song as the credits rolled. Did you hear that ""music""? Did they still have to try and shove the quasi new age ideology down our throats even after the movie was over??????? I think not. I found it offensive."
"I did not buy into the hype for this movie, I didn't pay attention to any of the previews or trailers. when I went to see it, I didn't expect to be blown away. I was. this movie might be Camerons best ever. that includes T2 and alien. some of the Na'avi looked so real it gave me the creeps. it was just phenomenal the way characters were developed and the way the forest was so alive. I am totally impressed by this movie and think in the future Avatar will be held up to such movies as star wars and the matrix I'd give it a ten, but I never give tens (except for 2001: a space Odyssey)"
Contrary to nearly everyone else's views on this movie I despise it. When I first heard this movie was coming out I thought it would be about Aang (Avatar: The Last Airbender). So they stole the name forcing 'The Last Airbender' not to be called by it's true name so as not to cause confusion.The special effects in this movie are bigged up to be amazing so I was appalled to see that they had spent so much money on this movie when they were terrible. I was watching Harry Potter (Philosopher's Stone) and was upset to see that the standard in Harry Potter (bearing in mind the age difference) was of a much higher degree.Overall I believe this movie is a disgrace. Not a very interesting storyline. Goes on forever. Terrible Effects. A Name Stealer.
"Well, I have to say I'm not exactly an enthusiast of this movie. James Cameron does it again and is able to create a huge blockbuster that everyone seems to like, that seems to be carved to do big in the Oscars but again I'm left with a bittersweet taste that this will not have, like Titanic, a very long life in the top of the best movies. For me the movie seems to try to disguise the simple plot with a wide variety of computer graphics (not as amazing as I thought) and making it long, really long, so that it can leave us numb. Then they put all those 3d stuff flashing that is just pure evil to leave you amazed. But if you look behind the cosmetics you'll see a simple and uninteresting movie. The movie reminds a bit Miyazaki but without the passion, without the creativity, and embedded in action and corny scenes. Well maybe I'm broken. Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?"
"I am an avid sci-fi reader from the days of the 10 cent paperbacks. One of my anthology collections had this story in it, almost verbatim. But that being said, it is a wonderful, rollicking, happy and sad film. The special effects were hard to believe, going far beyond the Star Wars and Lord of The Rings series'. I do agree that the female character neytiri was quite attractive. Sitting next to my wife in the theater here in the Philippines (I am on extended vacation) I pointed out to her how much the character looked like she does. It is always fun to see the actor's face without the makeup, and HOW DID THEY DO THOSE EYES??? Someone was asking me if there might be a sequel, and I suppose it could happen, maybe a ""revenge of the earthlings"" type scenario...but regardless this film is extraordinary, even if totally borrowed from old sci-fi. Some day I will remember who wrote the story and relate it here. For now..GO SEE THIS FILM!!"
"Avatar is an excellent movie by any standard, but in 3-D it truly stands as the new gold standard in fantasy and/or sci-fi entertainment. Multiple elements make this a great movie: good story line with moral depth, interesting characters that we can care about (and the real brilliance here, of course, is that the avatar characters are as interesting, if not more so, than the ""real life"" characters), fabulous rich cinematography, seamless CG and special effects, and of course venturing into a brilliantly colored, multi-dimensional and mesmerizing world we've never seen before. In a packed theater, the end of this film came with enthusiastic applause from almost everyone in attendance -- interestingly, the last time I experienced a really identical experience was Titanic. Go figure! What more can be asked of a movie? Only the future will answer this question."
"I have little to say about this movie. To be honest, I didn't watch a GOOD movie in a long time. But this... This is awesome! A great production in every way. The argument, the effects, the audio... The history really makes us to ""feel"" the movie. The audio is so involving that we stuck on the screen for the almost 3 hours it has, without a break. It is really good. I'm glad that there's still people who know about making movies. I'm not even a movie expert, but I know when one of them is good enough. It is a long movie, and that's for sure, but it is very easy and delightful to watch. I can't express how much I liked it. People may think I'm overreacting, but I really think that this is an excellent movie.I liked it so much that I dare to give my 10 score. Recommended to anyone who enjoy a really good 3D cinema experience."
"James is God, and has created a world for us, in the year 2154, on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri system. This moon's inhabitants called the Na'vi are struggling with the arrival of our own species, the humans.The story is remarkable, not in the sense of originality, but in feeling. What do I mean feeling? I'll tell you.The Beauty of Feeling Cinema: When Jake (Sam Worthington) first enters his avatar, for the first time in the history of film, I experienced what I'll call breaking the wall of realism.I'm not talking about the graphic effects purely as well, sure it is a HUGE part of the experience, but what I'm getting at is that we (the viewers)are subjected to the experiences he has in this new body. As a paraplegic, he has this new found experience, this new world sucking him in, and it's a uplifting and applies so well in the film standard.The way Cameron compares the viewer to the realizations of Jake Sully are unparalleled. He puts you into his skin more or less, letting the world of Pandora swallow you up, chase you, curse you, and then what you see, is that this place is worth fighting for. And that is what happens, you want to fight for Pandora.Luckily, your fight only requires watching the story unfold, but it is so involving, that I felt wonder. Yes, pure wonder. The scenes of wonder are limitless, and most of the great wonders hardly contain dialog and oddly enough, the dialog is the weakest part of the film, though it really doesn't matter. We experience the world of Pandora.The flying scenes are the most spectacular display of cinema submersion I've ever seen...This movie is visually and psycologically beautiful in ways most movies could only dream. It isn't perfect, what is? And yes, there will be a lot of opinion about its stature as a huge production.No one can deny that it is entertaining for many, and I'm not trying to win it a battle, opinions are what they are, but for the majority of people less concerned with complex plots and new story gimmicks, that just want a good ol' time at the movie theater. James delivers.10/10 Excellent Film Making is Excellent"
"So, I'm not a reviewer but just got back from seeing the Movie and whilst I didn't go WoW! I must comment on the completeness of the film.what feeling I had walking away was Humanity... and it took an alien nation to show it.The 3d effect was good without making you feel ill, and the alien landscape was amazing. The acting was excellent and the dialogue was very natural, OK there was a few cliché's but hey it just reinforces the characteroverall though I was fully immersed in the film and didn't feel that there was any weaknesses. and would look forward to a sequel"
"Imagine being able to explore an entire alien world full of imagination from the comfort of your nearest cinema; not so difficult to do seeing as the same thing could be said for many sci-fi flicks of the past century (star wars, planet of the apes, and star trek to name a few). The problem with these movies is that no matter what the director did or how well developed the plot was, they could never fully capture you and make you feel like you were a part of the movie; fortunately, James Cameron's Avatar 3D does just that. With state of the art animation and effects and a reported budget of nearly half a billion dollars, this movie has all the bells and whistles to make this movie a heart pounding, jaw dropping extravaganza of epic proportions, not to mention the story line which compliments the cinematography perfectly. All in all, it looks like James Cameron has captured the hearts of yet another generation of movie goers."
"The last time I was this thrilled, was while watching Jurassic park. I have never liked a 3D movie so much before Avatar. From the moment Sam Worthington's ""avatar"" lands into Pandora, it is an adrenaline pumping action till the end.For the first time I loved a movie, whose trailer I hated. I went to see this movie just because of the hype and publicity - and I was wrong. The trailer of this movie gives out nothing, unlike other trailers (which tells the whole story in 2 minutes).This is also the first movie that I would like to see again in the theater!"
"I have great respect for James Cameron. I am very fond of his ""Terminator"", ""Alien"" and ""Titanic."" He made his long break. The script for ""Avatar"" was lying on the shelves for many years, many were waiting for this movie. Of course, all the sublime expectation, ""It's Cameron."" I did not like the movie. In the first due to the fact that they call it the best film of the 21st century, why he is the best? It was in fact a lot of other, more interesting movies. Secondly, it is absolutely stupid plot, the lack of game actors. This is not a movie, and one large computer. If anyone should be praised and so it is not Cameron, and artists. This film does not deserve such a large box office receipts, it is simply empty."
"You've seen this story before. You haven't seen it in this exact way before, but the story is so basic and awful that it'll take away from all of the ""stunning"" visual effects.First off, let me address the 3D in this movie. It's worthless. Officially worthless. You see, the trouble here is that there are a few scenes that just scream out ""OMG YOU'RE WATCHING THIS IN 3D!"" The rest of the movie is comprised of scenes where there are a few things up close enough for your eyes to focus on, and then literally everything else is too far away to grasp the distance on, so your eyes are focused on infinity, thus sending most of the 3D effect in to the trash. If you were super impressed with the 3D it's because you've either never seen a 3D movie before, or because you went in to it wanting to be impressed. I watched a documentary on sea creatures back in the late 90's that had the exact same 3D quality that the 3D scenes in this movie had. The 3D in this movie is nothing that hasn't been done before.Second, the story. This movie may have been filmed in 3D, however they couldn't get the characters correct because they're all one dimensional. Yup. Flat as cardboard. At this point you may as well be watching Twilight. The story itself follows a very basic path. And it's not a good one at that. Hero comes in and misjudges everyone in his new environment. Hero goes out on a mission and meets the natives and has his eyes opened. Unfortunately by this point the hero has already given critical information to the people he thought were the good guys and they use it just at the moment when he is ready to convert to the real good guys, showing them that he's actually one of the bad guys. But he's not, he's the hero. So our hero goes out and accomplishes the token difficult task and the real good guys are now suddenly impressed with the hero. Big battle ensues. Deus Ex takes over, and the hero is now one completely and totally one of the good guys, all of his dreams come true and he lives happily ever after with the girl of his dreams.This movie uses every trick in the book to not just lead the audience through the story, but to beat them over the head with just exactly who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The Navi's with their giant eyes signaling to you a sense of honesty and vulnerability. Captain Douchebag with the scar across his face and the comedic scene where he drinks coffee while watching horrific destruction, signaling to you that he's evil incarnate.People, did you watch the trailers? I know they were shoved down my throat with every movie I watched before Avatar was released. Each and every trailer showed the beginning, middle and hinted at what the end could be. A couple friends of mine wanted to see it and so I ended up going with them. My suspicions were confirmed. This movie is absolutely, without any exception, a terrible terrible film.Save yourselves. Don't see it. Or if you do see it, at least put up an MST3k silhouette on your screen so you can at least pretend the movie is entertaining enough to warrant an MST3k episode."
"A masterful polemic by a man who evidently quite properly despises the species he was born into.No expense was spared in this tour-de-force of anti-mankind propaganda, complete with lovely blue kitty-cat aliens, sure to seduce younger viewers into wishing they had been born anything but human, as (with certain Cameron-approved exceptions, such as those who wish to reject their humanity and culture and join the lovely blue kitty-cat opposition) all humans are, as we all know, evil, wanton, destructive demons bent on destroying nature and beauty, preferably with the most flammable means at their disposal.The fact that the plot may be somewhat derivative of a half-dozen or so prior films should in no way detract from the important message this film has to deliver of the basic worthlessness of all human culture up to this point (except for Native American, Asian, African and anywhere else that isn't Western European), and if you do not walk away from this film with the proper sense of loathing for yourself, your family, everyone you know, and every human being who has ever been born or will ever be born (except for James Cameron), then you are obviously a selfish wastrel bastard who hates lovely blue kitty-cat aliens, actual kittens, and the universe itself."
"This movie was a total waste of three hours of time I could of put to better use watching porn and be less ashamed I watched it afterwards. I found myself hoping for that blue chick to get naked, but instead there I am sitting in the theatre with an erection and nothing to do with it. There wasn't even a point where I could relieve myself and stand up to get popcorn to make the movie slightly bearable to sit through. I was p**sed! From all the quarter-second nip-slips, I could have sworn they would throw me something I could use. The reason I had to desperately hope for nudity through this movie is because its story was unoriginal and packed with stupid gimmicks to make people ignore the bad writing. Also all its characters were one dimensional and very uninspired making me not care about them whatsoever. The main characters 'dramatic decision' he had to make has been used so many times before, and was so poorly executed that you know what choice he's going to make the second you see the options he has. Also the CGI sucked because they over-emphasized it being so-called 'State-of-the-Art' CGI, so I knew for sure it was fake, I couldn't believe or enjoy it. Overall, I would rather watch a man pulling up old carpeting than this Hollywood garbage."
"The hype surrounding this movie is not unmerited - the visual effects are stunning, and offer a look into the future of the film industry. Cameron's enormous budget funded the most spectacular creation of a foreign plant and people, creating features so lifelike it drew the audience into the lush, vivid world of Pandora. Unfortunately, for all the hype and enormity of the budget, Cameron failed to find a screenplay that complimented his visual artistic brilliance. I admit that it would have been nearly impossible to find a storyline as descriptive as the world Cameron created, but he could have at least tried. There is minimal character development, and the story relies too heavily on preconceived stereotypes from the audience. Hence, the title of my post ""Incomplete Artistic Brilliance""; movies are a unique form of artistry because they are most capable of affecting the senses we use in daily life, and Cameron fails to fill anything but the visual sense. The ultimate test of this movie will be time, since ten years from now productions of this visual level will be commonplace, though with far superior plots, diminishing Avatar's revolutionary appearance."
"Where to start. First off it's not as bad as some people say nor is it anywhere near as good as the hype. Basically it's a tired old story and a very unoriginal telling of it to make possibly THE most over rated movie of all time. The plot if you can call it that revolves around a planet populated by hippie smurfs armed with bows and arrows who live in a rather large tree and love everything who find themselves in conflict with evil alien invaders (or Americans as the rest of us know them) who have taken a fancy to a mineral called SpongeBobanium.Now SpongeBobanium does not seem to actually do anything (because nobody mentions why it's so valuable) but does looks real cool when placed in an ashtray and used for a paperweight and is coveted by said alien invaders who have done all they can to ridicule silly native beliefs and undermine Smurfs way of life by teaching them English and importing Starbucks,Rustyburger and probably baby Jesus to no avail so have decided that killing everyone would be easier so to that end infiltrate a wheelchair bound ex marine to spy on them disguised as a 10 ft smurf. Sadly for alien invaders ex marine goes native almost instantly and falls in love with smurfette princess then proceeds to teach peace loving smurfs how to kick ass by virtue of being the chosen one as ordained by some seeds from a tree. Cue lots of learning about the power of the planet and some soul searching from evil aliens as to whether they are right to do so prior to unleashing a high tech hell onto the peace loving smurfs big tree home which leads to the big fightback scene and ultimate victory for the smurfs. So many tales have been ripped off here that the list would stretch from here to Tokyo. Needless to say very few have been told as dull as this one. Visually it is pretty neat but nowhere near the level that has been drooled over. The landscapes never look real and were better as Yes and Uriah Heep covers in the 70s and I do not believe anyone thought for a second that the smurfs look anything other than CGI generated PC game characters. Obviously JC has gathered all those game designers who worked on C&C and Alien predator as well as a few disgruntled ex Jurrasic park folks but his flora and fauna look as fake as they do in .......fill in the name of your fave PC shooter....... Fun but daft and certainly not worth the million Oscars it is up for. In the same way Titanic was over rated garbage this falls into the same category. Perhaps it has advanced film making a tad or two but even the shiny-shiny of the CGI cannot eclipse the fact the acting is poor and the script drivel. Overlong and ultimately a bit tired and old hat.The obvious Avatar 2 will be. Jake looks up at the sky lovingly and says to princess smurf. 'look a beautiful shooting star' when suddenly several thousand neutron bombs explode around him killing everything in an instant. Wait a few months for rads to die down then evil aliens come back and mine the cr#p out of smurf planet and take SpongeBobanium back home because smurfs big mistake was not realising we are even more evil then they could possibly imagine. And probably only wanted SpongeBobanium because they had it and we didn't. Earth 1 Smurfs 0......makes you proud to be human! :)"
"Some people say this is the best they've ever seen. I would advice those people to at least watch the following movies without 3D. 1. The Shawshank Redemption 2. The Godfather 3. The Godfather: Part II 4. Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo. 5. Pulp Fiction 6. Schindler's List 7. 12 Angry Men 8. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 9. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back 10. The Dark Knight. Of course this is IMDb's top 10. Those movies are top because of a good story, good acting, great visuals and unforgettable scenes, music and quotes. Avatar does not have this combination to my opinion. The 3D visuals are sometimes spectacular but many times during action scenes you can not follow on screen what is going on. It doesn't have an original tune, it does not have an exciting story and the acting isn't that great either. I'd rather see a 2D movie without glasses(why do I have lenses in the first place)and with a good story than 3D without a gripping storyline. I wonder if this movie still stands in a couple of years from now after multiple viewings and after the first excitement has died down. I think it won't."
"I'm not a very frequent moviegoer. But when I go, I usually choose a movie of which I have very high expectations. Not with this one. But I'm glad I saw it on the big screen.I only came along with some friends of mine who had been dying to see this movie ever since it was first mentioned in the media. I went in expecting a lame story with good visuals. I was right about the story. The main story is something I've seen a couple of times before. The main character needs to choose between good and evil. Good being the beautiful, primitive, agile and spiritual Na'vi and evil being the hostile, heartless human *ssholes. That works well for the average moviegoer but a little more depth in the story wouldn't hurt anyone. That being said I move on to the visuals. And that's what makes up for a whole lot of the simple story. I'd heard that it was a spectacular movie but it turned out to be spectacle unlike I had ever seen before. The Planet of Pandora is a fairytale-like world with beautiful, surreal nature. I saw the movie (like many others. It has been sold out for over a month now.) in 3D. That made Everything even better. When looking down a ravine you'll find yourself dizzy from the height and when in a mission briefing you'll be listening from the back row. Though I had expected more 3D-effects, When you see it, You see it good.I usually choose a deep, complex story over great spectacle but I'm happy I made this exception. This is the next episode in cinematic visuals."
"Avatar is a special-effects laden adventure with a tiresome story. It is only the technical nous which gives Avatar a certain gravitas that one has to acknowledge. The 3D for all its efforts is not pioneering and the media fanfare seems to be misplaced.Having watch Avatar the 3D effects are underwhelming. I have not seen any 3D films in recent years and was expecting technical wizardry, and effects which would revolutionise the cinematic experience. Instead although the effects are good and better than the standard fare it was a tremendous letdown. At times the images become blurry and in other intense action scenes rather messy. As the 3D effects did not meet the high expectations the story had to come more to the fore but its formulaic plot and threadbare story do little to propel or inject excitement.The biggest problem is the persistence to provide so much of Pandora and the Naavi way of life. It languishes in Pandora for so long that you begin to crave some human reality not the pomposity of how wonderful the world looks. The Naavi are not given enough screen-time for us to have a natural empathy for them, instead the film focuses on spirituality and the beauty of Pandora. The second-act is unashamedly stereotypical and preachy about the natural world. The second-half needed to inject fresh impetus after is initial technical offering but it plants itself in very run of the mill territory.Avatar is overly long and overly dramatic. Unfortunately, its blanket of special effects stand alone in providing the entertainment factor as the structure of the story is weighed down in a very familiar formulaic manner."
"Words cannot describe how i feel right now!! Tonight was avatar's premier in my country and i went and saw it and MAAAAAN, IT WAS BEYOND Awesome! Really one of the best movies ever made! A must watch! Not at all just another sci-fi movie! I do agree that the effects are beyond awesome! But its the movie overall that touched my soul and got me involved the whole time! Believe it or not, i even forgot to breath at some points in the movie! The best thing that i liked about it was that it never got boring! Not at any point! In the end all i have to say is, no matter if u are a guy or a girl, I assure u that u will be amazed!My final words: If u don't see Avatar in a cinema, Let me tell u, U have missed out on the experience of a lifetime!"
"You must see this movie!!!!! Sure, it's Hollywood hokum at it's finest, but OMG, the effects and story are absolutely incredible. You will not believe your eyes! Not since Lord of the Rings has a movie made such a lofty statement about humanity, or presented it in such a phenomenally realistic vision, and in 3D no less! But you have to see it in 3D, NOT 2D. It's the best Si-Fi movie EVER, and probably the best movie of the last 10 years (sorry fantasy fans of LOTR). SEE IT, SEE IT, SEE IT ---> N O W <---! It's almost 3 hours long, but I'm seeing it again Tues or Wed., and that's a lot of wasted time for me, but if you don't see it in 3D, you'll regret it! I'm blown away, a gasp, stupefied, entranced, censoriously stunned, and as thoroughly pleased as I EVER have been with ANY movie of ANY genre. It easily trumps every movie of the last 10 years. I feel as though I will NEVER enjoy a 2D movie again."
"I can't remember a time when a movie has ever lived up to its hype, but this one did. Avatar is a stunningly beautiful movie, but beyond cinematography and special effects there was excellent acting, very engaging characters and gripping storytelling. While some may consider the storytelling somewhat cliché, I would respond by saying that the simplicity of premise is more than made up for by the masterful way in which it is presented. This movie is simply a cinematic masterpiece and if there is any justice it will garner a lot of attention from the academy. It was easily worth the increased ticket price to see it in IMAX 3D. This one is a must see.For parents - you don't have any worries with sex or nudity in this one. The PG-13 is definitely for the violence, though even that avoids gore. Mostly explosions and some big alien creatures. Besides the violence, there's a little language, but really nothing you wouldn't encounter on television."
"Avatar is a stunning achievement, the definitive big-screen event of our generation. Words seem hopelessly inadequate to try and capture its spectacular three-dimensional glory, but suffice it to say that it sucks you in and immerses you smack bang into a whole new world, giving you a cinematic experience so god damned rich it becomes impossible to assess it as a mere movie. Watch this, and watch it in 3D. Trust me. I watched the 3D version yesterday and I was spellbound during the entire movie. This is a tale of love. Of greed. Of dreams. Of people. Of mercy. Of vengeance. Of faith. This is a tale of life, and it genuinely gives you the taste of a whole new one. The themes are simple but the mythology is deceptively nuanced, and one never expected the most expensive film in the history of cinema to be subtle in any way."
"Pointless by-the-numbers movie with stereotypical characters and unconvincing acting all around. Didn't need to be made. The novelty of the CGI wears off quickly and then there's another 2 hours of movie to slog through. I was expecting better from James Cameron. So many years in development and yet almost nothing creative in it. It seems with CGI there's even less room than usual to change things as you go along when it becomes apparent they're not working. But the script, written by Cameron, was quite bad to begin with. He must have just been given free reign due to his past successes, and, given the commercial success of Avatar, will probably be again, unfortunately, with no one daring to tell him anything sucks or that its been done better before and he needs to either come up with something new or find someone who can. The story was so derivative and simplistic I felt like rolling my eyes and had to make myself finish it. I'll certainly be screening his future movies more carefully, no matter how much money they make."
"If you are under 12, you might find this movie exciting, but just because the movie has digitally animated characters doesn't make it good- just a glorified cartoon. Personally, I found the 1970's/80's special effects much more realistic looking (Remember some of the characters from the first three Star Wars movies?) The plot of Avatar is nothing new- a bunch of greedy/irresponsible scientists and military planning to invade/exploit a harmless bunch of natives.The main female avatar was especially annoying- whiny, unstable and hostile- but hey, isn't how most female characters are (unfortunately) portrayed on TV and in movies these days? If you saw Avatar because it was 3D, the effects were pitiful compared to those (albeit very gory effects) of My Bloody Valentine or The Final Destination."
"There's enough reviews, my only complaint is a major technical one that you would think Cameron would have noticed given that he went over every frame of the movie a thousand times. Why are the Avatars approximately 9 feet tall for the entire movie (you get a good idea of their scale in the first scene when he wakes up in his new Avatar and breaks out of the lab. The Avatars are 3-4 feet taller than an average human) THEN - in one of the final scenes SPOILERRRR!!! When the Avatars are lined up in a row and overseeing the humans marching onto their ship to go back to earth after the Avatars win the war, the Avatars are MORE THAN DOUBLE AND LOOKS LIKE TRIPLE THE SIZE OF A HUMAN!! There's one shot and Giovanni Ribisi's character looks like he's looking at a cloud. I think the artists got the perspective wrong or something. Humans barely come up to the knees of the Avatars in this one scene but in the hand to hand combat scene between Worthington's character and the Colonel guy they're reasonably close in size. This is my only review of the movie other than the story is far more simple than I expected. I judge a movie by whether or not I would see it again and I doubt I would see this again."
"Its the first movie which loads of audiences paid to watch in 3D, and to find out 3D didn't really worth the money so it will also be the last 3D movie they'd paid to watch to this day.🤷‍♂️
It got simple storyline, okay acting, and whole bunch of CGIs. Fine.
But is it worthy to be a top grossing movie? I don't think so."
"I saw Avatar twice, not really by choice. The first time in 2D, so right off the bat, the experience was diminished by 100%. An hour and a half in I was more then ready for the story to wrap up. The story itself isn't bad by any means, but it drags on and on through its tedious run time. The second time i saw it was in 3D and was seen because it was a unanimous vote between a group of friends of mine. I figured sure, it'll be in 3D which will add a whole new dimension to my opinion, literally. Once again, it maintained its mediocrity. The visual effects are quite impressive, but had no real standout moments in 3D. And there's something i just can't get through my head, and that's how people love this movie so much. It's really not anything groundbreaking, it's good visual effects. Forgive me if i seem critical, but something this tedious should not have such a high rating. The story isn't bad, but nothing great."
"It was a great looking film.Aliens were tall and regal.Alien plants exotic and luminescent. Alien wild life, a strange mutation of creatures we have on earth, except much more dangerous and spectacularly primal.Thus ends the good review portion of this write up.The rest of the film however... was less than stunning.We have a hero without much personality - wheelchair bound - unemotional, and demonstrates this when he doesn't even mourn the death of his twin brother for one second. Yes. This is literal not metaphorical. Try counting the moments where this hero actually has real emotions for his own flesh and blood. And yet later in the film, he is supposed to be in touch with the planet he now inhabits. As a cheat, the film suggests his rivers run deep. Telling us he is some kind of deeply spiritual being. All this is well and good, however he has very little empathy for others around him. He is wide eyed and naive at best and at his worst is simply unintelligent and reactive. Not exactly the picture of enlightenment he is purported to being. What is insulting to the intelligence is how our human hero goes on to being the savior of the native aliens towards the end of the film. Somehow, he is the one chosen to deliver these already intuitive and spiritual beings from their own naivety and lack of combat strategy skills. On top of which, he gets the biggest dragon too. So all in all, the film shows us he becomes the best alien, when only half an hour ago he was a lumbering clumsy buffoon. Miraculously he masters their language in record time, is more agile than his other human colleagues who have been training for years. In other words, he was born to be an alien.So, let's say we the audience buy into this. Other contradictions appear to destroy the illusion of a perfect transformation from human soul to alien spirit. This comes in the form of connection. When the chief of the alien tribe is killed... he continues his insensitive ways and does not shed a single tear. This, coming from the most connected alien in the whole bunch. The final insult of course comes in the form of his superiority over them all when he single handedly tames the biggest dragon in the sky. This preadolescent fantasy of bigger is better, and that ""I'm more enlightened than everyone and I don't even know how I did it"" is not an act of profundity, it's an act of suspending disbelief to the extent that we must be numb in the brain to not see this person is a callous immature person who does not deserve such high praises. A young unwise boy trapped in the body of an adult, trapped in a machine sending neural impulses to a electro-chemically remote controlled alien body trapped in a plot line involving mineral mining espionage which included a cigar chomping mercenary commanding officer and greedy corporate middle management stereotype. At its centre, the story is the imaginings of a child, stumbling around thinking he's a man, having sex with exotic beings and fighting and having fun with violence and explosions and crazy visually stunning landscapes. A perfect film for anyone with a mental age of 12 or below.Emotionally hollow, I can understand the fascination with this much hyped visual feast. Essentially it shows, we are superficial as a collective, unable to go past the eye's delight and can be manipulated into feeling something that isn't there if the images are able to tap into our subconscious yearnings. (We yearn to be thin, tall and agile; good looking and strong; we want to have sex with the alpha male or female and ride flying dragons; we want to be deeply connected to our environment without having to do any studying, reading and personal observation; and most of all we want to be loved by everyone, including creatures great and small who respect and even obey us. I remember having some of these very same fantasies at age 8. And before anyone thinks I have something against staying youthful, I don't. Being 8 is great, but at some stage, other people's feelings become important too. And if this film suffers from any one dilemma of a child's perspective, it is the flaw of being ultimately self centred and self serving. There is only one winner and it is that naive, good looking human who wanted to be respected and loved by everyone.)That said, I commend all the artists who worked on this film. They did an outstanding job at creating some of the most eye catching big screen images in recent years."
"This movie touted itself as ""something of which you've never seen the likes of"" however the story was COMPLETELY predictable. This wasn't the worst movie in the world but in comparison to its accolades, it's getting there.The movie has beat out ""Up in the Air"" and the amazingly original and inventive ""Inglorious Basterds"" for best picture Golden Globe. How is that reasonable? I could probably guess the whole story upon watching the first 10 minutes. I felt nothing for any of the characters except Sigourney Weaver.The icing on the cake was when Michelle Rodriguez (the pilot) started shooting and said, ""it's me bitch"". Why is this type of crass humor required in all movies? This isn't how people speak in life or death situations. This is how people speak in movies.The only thing very good about the movie was the amount of detail with special effects but this indeed is not what makes a movie. Furthermore the blue people, I forget what they are called were just taller and blue. Like nothing I've ever seen? Almost exactly everything I've ever seen. Two arms, two eyes, two legs, speaking with their mouths.That ""I see you"" crap repeated OVER AND OVER. Now, of course they did explain that this was something important and spiritual to the people. If so, they wouldn't say it English so many times because there wouldn't even be a direct translation.I really wish I was a billionaire so that I could pay some of these people billions to stop making movies like these."
"Well, I like the new experiences of 3D. I like the trees, I like the creatures, I like that the sky that looks real... I enjoy flying scenes, I really like the jelly fish alike creature, I like to watch how they seem to be dancing around me while I am sitting on my seat eating popcorn and drink shakes.Okay, It's a breakthrough in animation technology. Hmm.. but what about the story and characters? The Villain = military = anti environment = stupid destroyers. wow. we saw that in 37625 movies before. Love story = soldier fall in love with the natives/ enemy = cheesy dialog. do you still remember other 5847 movies tell the same things before Avatar?"
"It's sad to see how movies are being sold these days. It takes a couple of hundred staff employers to write 10-50 reviews each praising the movie to get it rated as one hell of a film. With a budget way over normal - they can afford it - and it pays off. It's truly sad, 'cause this film is so boring and uninteresting but still critics, and magazines as well, are bought just to secure high sales and nominations etc. Only the aftermath cannot be controlled, yet, and luckily so. Because in a couple of years this movie will go down as one of many minor movies and take the position it truly deserves - and yes! It's not one of the ""amazing experiences"", or: ""Best movie ever!!!"" DUH! Well, you got your few dollars, you sold your soul, and we got this booooring story wrapped up as the Emperor's new wardrobe. 3 stars for visuals - 0 for story, and 1 for total experience."
"Awful, awful waste of money and time. Hackneyed, cliché-ridden, and 3-D so what! Admittedly a strange nexus of events in my life did not help viewing. Within the last three weeks I have been to Orlando, and the 3-D in 'Avatar' cannot compare with the 'Simpson's Simulator Ride' for being 'in it.' When the natives fly vertically, we do not see it through their eyes - too many people would leave the cinema sick! I also caught the James Cameron-directed 'Terminator Experience' in 3-D. Guess what, twenty minutes of Cameron cinema worked, this does not. I am afraid the spectacle is pretty feeble, and I was not immersed in this Disney fairyland with its only a dozen or so creatures (money run out?). Now for plot and characterisation, or lack of, should I say! In the last few days I have watched 'Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee' - same story but it really happened - is Cameron paying the Sioux any royalties? Then last night I watched 'King Arthur' - a lanky female archer with little bre**ts painted in blue leading an attack of blueies on the bad guys - is Cameron paying Keira Knightley any royalties? And as for rip offs from Steven Spielberg and 'Jurassic Park' and Kevin Costner and 'Dances With Wolves' - well, we'd better not get started. Supposedly a sci-fi film, there are huge mechanical robocops, but the hero has to put up with a 1960s' wheelchair, while full body DNA replicants of an alien species can be produced, but the private contractor army has to make do (in 2154 AD) with 1990s' bullets, grenades and high explosive (money run out for lasers, James?)!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No, this has to be one of the worst, most underwhelming movies of all time. Music - would you believe I came out of the cinema humming 'Titanic?' Well done, Mr Horner! And to cap it all, when I got home 'Destination Moon' made in 1950 for peanuts was on TV - in five minutes showing take off from Earth, there was more realism and emotion than all of 'Avatar.' But I have given it 1. Why? Because James Cameron has persuaded his countrymen to spend a quarter of a billion dollars to make it, and hundreds of thousands of Americans to watch what is basically a straightforward condemnation of the USA's past 'push west' and present arrogant imperialism in Iraq and Afghanistan. Can't all be bad, can it?!"
"This comment is on the IMAX 3d version.There aren't many stories, are there? There are not many good storytellers either. Nor, it turns out, many filmmakers who can make even moderately big movies with a single governing imagination. That is the first quality I will report of this: that a single mind governed the creation and dynamics of this world and how we see it. The second quality is the experience of realism in the artificial faces. Both of those are reported by others well enough.What really impressed me was how deeply the philosophy of WETA has penetrated grand film-making. They did the world. Now, the world by itself would be remarkable. But Cameron clearly wanted the dimensionality of ""King Kong"" writ large. The thing is dimensional. The camera is placed in positions that no physical camera could; it moves in ways that are distinctly alien in the alien sections of the movie; the sequence of surrounding shots in a scene, particularly an action scene, is more than double what you normally would get and surrounds. The way it surrounds is taken from what WETA did with ""Van Helsing:"" the movements are those you see in the flight movements of the flying dragons. So they are of the movie and in the thing as well.There is, therefore, a distinctly Australia-New Zealand flavor to this. That isn't the only nontraditional self-referential bit. Cameron loves these. We have the filmmaker to the film as the same as the otherworld immersion set up and controlled by Weaver's character. And indeed she reports that she modeled her character on Cameron. The bit about the forest as a neuronal net is not entirely unlike what visionaries in the computer graphics world talk about having in the future.A significantly unsettling element is the weaponry. Somebody boot ILM out of the game. It is really likely that a future that can master space travel and DNA remoting is likely to rely on Viet Nam era things-that-shoot? The only reason they are there is so that for the final battle we can have traditional cinematic shootouts overlain on our by then well established dimensional reality. And gosh, have we had enough already of the enhancer suits? Though I cheered and cried with the crowd, I wish I could have left feeling that love story was unpolluted by the ordinary. One thing that I will predict. I trace the use of orreries and global machines in films, because it affects the vocabulary we can use in how we grow the cosmologies behind noir. Here we have the trees. One is huge and helical, a home to a population. It is downed like the World Trade towers by a guy out of central casting that in other theaters we are cheering because he is blowing up terrorists. Here he says he is fighting terror preemptively with terror.The second tree — the tree of souls — is not rendered well visually. But the idea is an amazing advance in film scriptology. It moved me as the guiding principle behind the inevitable love. That it collected the soul of Cameron's avatar was a bit delicious. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Zero is not possible, OK, so maybe 1 point for the message, which remains true no matter how badly you portray it: The Iraqis (etc.) sit on oil, so let's turn them into enemies and nuke'em... What I would love to do is torture Mr. Cameron as he tortured me with his script of platitude upon platitude - man, you're 55 years old, you must have something more to say and a more artful way to say it? Even this bad plot could have been filled with a script with more substance....oh my god! I've never played a shoot'em up video game, and I am not a fan of fantasy, so maybe I should never have watched this movie. Plus, I hate pastels...;-) I like CGI, but without a story ? Mr. Cameron should first have graduated at Pixar College - well, but maybe he would have flunked with flying pastels - maybe he lacks the talent...It is a boring, unoriginal, bad film, a cartoon of the flattest kind. Not worth seeing at all."
"Having just returned from the theater, we are just positively stunned by what we have just witnessed. Avatar is a grand and glorious adventure, breaking new ground in many segments of the movie-going experience. It's 3-D adaptation was seamless and flawless, adding great depth and feel to all aspects of the film. Just walking through the jungle became a wonder, with seemingly touchable grasses, insects flitting and grand inner depths to the longer shots. The world itself was an ingenious revelation, alight with creatures and plants and, yes, humanoids, fresh from Cameron's imagination. Luminescence is everywhere, from the ground moss to floating jelly-fish-like floating seedpods, to spiral plants and the most ethereal of glowing willows. Cameron's animals were crafted with skill and grand vigor, especially his hammer-headed rhino-like beast, wee feral-like out-world dogs, giant cats merged with beetles on steroids, and our favorites, the winged dragon-like beasties ridden by the hero and heroine alike. The story-line echoed any number of struggles between indigenous populations and invading ones (American Indian vs. settler/Gov't; Irish/Scottish/Welsh/South African/Indian/etc. versus British Empire; Mayan/Inca versus Spanish dominance) but told in a new-twist manner, with a backdrop of nicely developed characters and intricate world one comes to care about. I did not read any reviews before seeing the movie, not wanting to color my feelings. After reading a smattering upon our arrival back home, I see the vast majority are positive or more so, with just a few in the negative range. I applaud those who saw this ground-breaker for what it is -- and wonder what need be produced on the big-screen to better please those who could not find outright wonders in this creatively stunning film. See it at your single screen, the local multi-plex ... on IMAX ... but SEE IT at all costs!"
"I came to this film purely by chance. I had seen Sherlock Holmes and was heading to my car when my brother called. I met him at the exit to the cinema. I had an apparently ""speical"" offer. One of my brother's friends had gotten sick, so would I like to see Avatar? In IMAX 3D no less? I had seen T2 when I was younger, but the name of the director did not register to me. I had seen half of Alien before I ran screaming out of the room. I had never seen a trailer for this, and the only warning I got was a poster. The one with the Na'vi face. Not much of a heads-up! I went in not knowing anything. No plot, no expectations... And this move removed any limits I have put on a film. It was real. The planet, the Na'vi, and the humans. I came here and read the reviews before I went back and watched it. I have now seen it 3 times. For the apparent disappointment you seem to feel, I can not fathom. I am no movie critic. I am no Si-fi fan. But I think that if a language for a movie is made by a PHD, it might hold some water. If it is just like ""Dance with the Wolves"" (I have never seen) then...well, Where are wolves exactly? I certainly didn't see Ankin jump out at any point. Or the T-1000. And this wasn't an awful gushy romance like Titanic (the film was awesome, the actor's, no so much) . This move can hold it's own. The second one...well, I will be waiting."
"Truly amazing! This is the kind of movie you need to see ""at least"" twice because the graphics and special effects are so overwhelming that you miss a lot of the actual facts of the storyline. I've seen it twice on Imax, ready anytime to return for a third time and most definitely will purchase once it's sold on Blu-ray! Yes it is that good and anyone that reviews this badly either has not seen this incredible movie or... well quite frankly, I can't see why they would. It doesn't matter what kind of movie you like, it pretty much covers it. I'm truly glad that we have such a talented writer/producer as James Cameron to create such great entertainment. It might have taken him long to create this one, but it's certainly worth the wait! DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!"
"last night i saw avatar .i went to this movie with some great expectation and this movie fulfilled all my expectations.i saw it in 3d.the 3d effect was superb.James Cameroon has absolutely taken the special effects to the next level and am sure that this film will definitely prove to be the gateway for all the science fiction movies.i absolutely loved every minute of this movie.all the creatures in this movie looked so real and that too in 3d it was awesome.the characterization was excellent (especially of Jake Sully and Dr.grace was superb).this movie has all the ingredients in it to make it undoubtedly the best movie of the year and also the best movie in the history of Hollywood.all the credit goes to the master movie maker,James Cameroon.so i give this movie a 10/10."
"Amazing movie. The most fantastic movie I have seen in 20 years. As a matter of fact ever, since there is nothing like it. Just go and watch it. I went in expecting something special, and it really is something else. Absolutely fantastic universe created here. The visuals are absolutely stunning. And all the details are mind boggling. This is really a movie where you cannot give people an idea just by describing the plot. They just have to go see the movie. I just want see the movie once more. My son who's 11 years old said the same. He could not forget this movie, and want to go see it again. It is not the story but the way it's presented. A must see."
"The movie was absolutely amazing. Going in, I was a bit skeptical, being that the mineral was called ""Unobtainium"", which I found to be a bit laughable and had me worrying that the movie was going to be a bit of a joke with names. However, the movie did not disappoint. Pandora was a vibrant and living world, every single plant was designed beautifully and felt almost real. The Na'vi were also designed extremely well, and the CG made them appear to be real in all respects. The biggest fear I had was the 3-D aspect, what I expected to be the gimmick, where I would have an arrow fly by my face and water splash at me. This was not the case. it was truly immersive. I felt that I was looking out a window and seeing another world, one in which these people and creatures were actually existing.All in all, James Cameron has made another masterpiece, and I can not wait for the extended materials.I guess that is what happens when you spend 4 years in production, 6 in creating the 3-D cameras, 15 creating the story, and a lifetime imagining the world."
"*** contains minor spoilers *** visually, WERA has pushed film further than i imagined possible since the first LOTR film debuted a decade ago. the action is pure Cameron - very entertaining and visceral. i didn't even mind the weak and hackneyed characters (many of which make a return from Cameron's ""aliens"" including the bad-ass Latino marine chick (she even goes out in a similar way) and especially Giovanni Ribisi's reprisal of Paul Reiser's greedy bastard: Carter Burke) what i found difficult was the film's recycled elements of Cameron's career, some mainstream science fiction, a couple of video game plots, all centered around a story we've watched/read/played so many times already we're totally numb to it.the audience, root for the na'vi (all alien or fantasy races must have an apostrophe in their name, it would seem), completely ignore who the bad guys are.we are asked to think it is the humans of some distant future, the heartless corporate machine that none of us have anything to do with.oh really? that corporate machine is the very one that pumps out these ""blockbusters"" and all the associated merchandising. the real enemy is us. the now us. not a future, removed us. not some us that the current us are not responsible for just as we shun all responsibility for all the damage and evil our ancestors have done. the consumers who bends to the will of the corporation now and who leave the theater and go to the local burger king to eat cow (a once living sentient being the life of which a real na'vi would have respected (when was the last time you thanked a cow for providing you with a tasty burger made from its flesh?) and incidentally whose harvesting is the number one cause of deforestation of the planet earth which in the film is hinted to be devoid of green) and buy avatar toys made in china and of materials and via processes that simply add to the destruction of the planet (just as, in the ultimate irony, i once saw a box of no longer wanted wall-e toys discarded by a dumpster)...if only Cameron had the guts to give some ""humanity"" to the humans, to make the conflict a little gray. to make the audience see - it is people like us, not single minded soldiers, who are killing the na'vi. and lets not make the na'vi so innocent either. like the European conquest of America and it's natives, no one was blameless...it's pointless to lecture tho. in Cameron's world black is black and white is white and besides, he didn't make this film to make the audience think or pass on a moral lesson. he picked a premise from the extremely finite bucket of blockbuster formulas and made a film to sell tickets, push the technology, break box office records, entertain the brain stem and afterward bombard us with avatar merchandise.but doesn't that make him one of the bad guys?"
"A wag once said Hollywood gave GHANDI the Oscar because he represents everything Hollywood isn't--thin, tan, and moral. For AVATAR, we should add ""indigenous"" to that list. It takes the noble savage fantasy to ridiculous lengths and then, offensively, uses it to lash out at the War Against Islamic Jihad. The story looks as though someone threw up DANCES WITH WOLVES on THE LION KING at a Moveon rally.English-speaking earthlings are the baddies here, bent on destroying the harmonious moon-loving hunter-gatherers in pursuit of filthy strip-mining lucre. Never mind Western culture invented most of the ideas about fair play and tolerance that are turned against us in moronic pulp diatribes such as this, or that industrial civilization feeds a crowded planet of 6,692,030,277. Lines such as ""We'll fight terror with terror."" and ""Shock and awe"" make it pretty clear that the real target of Mr. Cameron is America, its values, and its industry.Mr. Cameron (who controlled every iota of what made it to the screen) may think the plight of his N'avi is comparable to that of Islamic terrorists but I don't recall the part where the N'avi come to earth and kill 3,000 of our people. Or the part where the N'avi capture innocents and saw their heads off on video with rusty knives. Or the N'avi law that stones a woman who is raped as an adulteress unless three men support her accusations. We're fighting benighted, medieval darkness here on earth, not enlightened nature lovers, and if Mr. Cameron chooses not to get it, I suggest he go to Afghanistan and experience their film-making first-hand.This is $300 million of scurrilous 3D poop. Skip it."
"The movie of movies, you can watch it a million times"
"I can not wait for part two, this movie is brilliant!"
I didn't know that most of this film is CG until 2 years after release. No words to explain about film.
"technically groundbreakingvisually stunningaction packedsolid story that is transparent with real historythe generic characters to some people might be a downside; however, they're in the story with purpose"
Avatar is one of my favourite movie no one can beat this movie I watched this movie 30 times
"So i have watched it more than 8 times, but can count 8times for sure and I'll update this review if i watch it again. If you are bit fantasy type you'll definitely love it. If you don't watch movie you'll love it 😂... And if you watch movies try avatar one more time until you get the concept of liking it. For your kind information i watched this movie in cinema in 2018 after already watched it 7 times 😂😂👍🎦."
"To sum up this predictable, unoriginal blockbuster - A glorified, 3 hour long advert for 3D cinema and stunning visuals. I won't lie this film is beautiful in scenery and CGI is top class but, this movie relies entirely on its visuals and did not captivate me for more than a couple minutes!"
"Avatar is James Cameron's child in waiting for longer than a decade. Twelve years since Titanic Cameron again delivers with a great science fiction epic with the usual tropes and clichés but somehow making it work. The film looks gorgeous and the planet Pandora will surely give nature pangs to many of us. It makes me wonder how much a great storyteller's skills matter- Everything and everyone was against Cameron and somehow, he has managed to deliver. If you haven't seen Avatar(how?) you should see it as soon as possible- this is a great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker."
"Hi, I've seen this movie before in my head. I did not miss anything in my mind. I did not understand the story. It was a coincidence that I decided to see you again. Good. Excellent. I did not have one of the best movies of history with special effects. Drama of the drama of the drama is beautiful and excellent. Humanitarian. For the Environment. James Cameron"

"After Terminator and Aliens, we got Avatar, set on a distant moon in a distant galaxy. We get a handicapped young soldier and his quest to seek out Pandora (the moon) and see the sights and help his company. Plus, we also get Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. And an all-new alien world. The special effects didn't hurt either. Sure, the story is a little cliched (Ferngully and Dances With Wolves anyone?) but it's not bad. The Na'vi stole the show as the moon's indigenous people and their customs and various creatures were so beautiful. This makes me curious for the followups. Hope they'll expand the whole Avatar story even further!"
"This movie was a complete shocker. The acting was so bad I could not stay with it. When acting is terrible it is tough to stay ""in the movie"". They really should have cast some more accomplished actors. The scenery was so terrible. It was just too fake and plastic looking for me to settle in and enjoy it.The aspect that really got me was the predictable and boring story-line. It was so predictable that I considered switching it off numerous times. The only reason I watched the entire movie is because of the hype that it generated at the box office. Boring!"
"Avatar is the bestest movie in a long long time. It's a sight to be seen. If you thought Lord of the Rings had cool effects than you don't know anything. Avatar has taken visual effects and brought them to a new high. I don't think any movie can ever beat Avatar's special effects for a long long time. It's pretty early sure but I think Avatar will be judged as one of the greatest movies of all time. It has a classic storyline of good and evil, right and wrong, but it is only with blue aliens instead. Cameron has created his own brilliant world and populated it with aliens with a unique mythology. We want to know how to be like them but only action hero Sam Worthington can discover the secrets. The idea of the Avatar is one of the most original sci-fi creations. It takes a certain inspired brilliance to have Jake Sully a wheel chaired guy to become a creature of the forest through virtual reality. The 3-D in Avatar is by far the best I've ever seen. If you want great 3-D than Avatar is the way to go. James Cameron is the King of the World and if I were him I'd simply retire because he has made a great movie, too great really. All other Sci-Fi epics pale in comparison to Avatar. Stephen Lang's character is a better villain than Darth Vader..."
"At one point in Avatar the military unit on Pandora throws gas canisters into the home of the Na'vi. A shot shows one of these gas canisters hitting the ground and rebounding; sitting in the theatre with my 3D glasses on I flinched. 3D is cool.Approximately fifteen years after originally conceived, Avatar is finally in theatres and it is, amazing. The story centres on Jake Sully and his experiences on a planet called Pandora that humans have recently discovered. On Pandora there are all kinds of new life including the Na'vi, a race similar to humans except overall just better. Due to really really cool technology Jake controls an avatar (a body that looks just like a Na'vi) and can see, hear and feel through his avatar all from the comfort of the lab. Soon he (as in his avatar) is living with the real Na'vi, learning their ways, falling in love and eventually protecting them against the greedy, capitalistic humans. This story is complicated but James Cameron has almost three hours for it to develop and the plot never feels rushed.The story alone is interesting enough to make this movie worthwhile but it is the visuals that set this movie apart. A whole new world has been created with this movie. Pandora looks like Discovery Channel's Holy Grail; every minute detail is incredible, from the Na'vi to the plants in the background of some unimportant scene. The hours logged to make this movie must be astronomical. Even the technology of the humans is cool and least remotely realistic. Giant planes and helicopters, impressive iron man-robot-type-deals, hell the breathing masks are cool.And then there's the 3D. Avatar is considered the first 3D movie directed at adults; translation being: this movie will make or break the future of 3D. Luckily it's made it. Besides the whole ""look-something's popping out of the screen"" gimmick 3D is amazing because it makes everything look ultra-high-definition. Scenes are given layers and the audience is brought that much closer into the film. This movie has shown that even romantic comedies could have 3D in the future; maybe James Cameron is king of the world.What this movie needs now is a prequel. How did humans discover/locate /get-to/land-on /settle/learn-the-language /set-up-a-school/create-avatars /discover-that-expensive-mineral /develop-the-technology /etc./etc./etc.? And what about on earth, are there avatars there, are wars being fought with casualties that aren't real? What do people think of Pandora, how are the international politics playing out? If it takes six years to get to Pandora but you don't age during that time, that's got to create some weird things; a mother could end up six years older than her child. Avatar ignores a lot of questions that could fit into a whole other movie.Avatar is the future of film, there is no doubt in my mind that more and more action movies will begin to be made in 3D, with other genres soon to follow. James Cameron has created an epic movie, that movie-goers will swarm to and that will inspire the film industry and its future direction. And it only took fifteen years and three hundred million dollars."
"Whatever it costs to get a HD big screen TV capable of playing 3D, along with the player and the glasses, I WILL PAY IT. I don't care if I have to sell my corvette. I don't even have a big screen TV now.Terminator and Aliens are two of my favorite all-time movies. JC has since come out with Abyss and Titanic - both good but neither making any of my top lists. So I wasn't expecting something nearly awesome. This was. People say the story is weak. It isn't. People say it is derivative - ALL movies are derivative, even Terminator, even Aliens and even Titanic - this movie has plenty which separates it. And the characters have depth even if you sometimes have to read between the lines to see it. Aside from those talking points, the f/x, action sequences, epic scale, and raw fun are all magnificent. And I haven't used the word magnificent in years and I'm pretty sure my use of it was related to 'The Magnificent Seven'. The movie is as entertaining as I can imagine a movie to be."
"Avatar gets a 10 because of its visuals and some of the natural soul satisfying themes therein. The rest of the film does not matter; I'll explain why.The plot is as standard and as conventional as they come. The whole film is a collective of clichés and things we have all seen before on screen. A Marine without the use of his legs becomes part of a program on Pandora. Selected individuals become the 'avatars' that have been specifically engineered for them and go out into the alien world of Pandora. The objective: to study the natives, indigenous 'beasts,' life forms and layout of terrain in the interests of military tactical advantage. The Marine is given the incentive of government-approved working legs if he is successful in completing the objective. Marine, assisted by ever so cheesy, clichéd, cartoonish two-dimensional characters enters world, meets girl, meets tribe, learns ways, gets accepted, falls in love, and ultimately decides in all predictability that Pandora is more valuable to him than the 'real' world. That's about ten or so films that we can all list covered so far. And so 'jarhead' ultimately becomes protagonist, protector and defender when the 'good' guys who are fighting the 'savages' decide it's time to eradicate and show them just who is boss. Don't you love the mentality :) So, back to the reason of sitting in the theater with 3-D glasses. It takes a little while, but the reason for every Effects house, department, and agency working on a 400-million dollar film becomes oh so very apparent. So I am a gamer, very much accustomed to playing pretty games on high-end tech. I am also a film geek, details, details, details. So, you will understand that when the lights go down a little and I'm looking at 'other worldly' vegetation full of sap or rain water, and I sit there shaking my head because my brain can't seem to compute that specially created/generated foliage defies that very concept. When the lights go down on Pandora I might as well be looking out of my own window. Indeed, I was also dubious when I heard a similar statement. Avatar, when you get past - but can't really get past - because you are looking at animation that looks so real that you can instantly (pretty much) tell who the actor is behind the 'mask' - the phenomenal visuals. You are allowed to smile, and perhaps to have your eyes well up a little, with Jake's first encounter as a 'Dragon' rider. Here perhaps is a nod to Anne McCaffrey's 'Pern.' The rider chooses the Dragon and the Dragon the rider. When the bond is made, they become one. I want to get back to the characters again. Remember when I said details, details, details: The skin, the eyes, the flakes of dust that land on the skin after an explosion, the ears that move and stretch. the physical motions and motor skills. What is the expression I am looking for.. 'more human than human'. OK, time to close. The weakest link, in my opinion, and I truly hate to say this out of my respect for one of the mothers of sci-fi, is Sigourney Weaver's character. Rather than playing a secure, natural maternal scientist we have a re-hashed Ripley after 23 years, only it only serves to weaken the experience. As soon as Sigourney opens her mouth, I want her to close it. It's not big, it's not clever; and I don't care if it's a military 'thing' in a PG-13 film. The mild swearing is out of place. Some of the audience cheered and clapped when Michelle (signature frown and growl) Rodriguez says: ""You're not the only one with a gun, bitch!"" Why do women need to grow balls in these flicks.. You don't need to compete with the alpha male who is doing a fine job of cheapening the human race. It sounds great coming from Sigourney Weaver, in full control of a robot walker facing off against mother Alien, but it's not 'Aliens', it's Rodriguez with a pair who should stay in films that go straight to video shelf. I perceive that there is a reason behind the far too obviously staged overacting. It contrasts with the wonderful soothing, soul enriching acting from the Naa'ri. It also serves to exploit the human race for what they are: Takers, antagonists, butchers, and barbarians. Avatar is the current apotheosis of the reason we enjoy cinema. Anyone who is anyone can enjoy it, though preferably not younger children. Kids and adults alike who don't understand (or care about) the plot can get lost in the amazing world of Pandora.Highly recommended, not something that should be missed on the biggest, most technically capable theater you can find. Can't be described, needs to be seen to be believed."
"I used to think that Lord of the Rings was THE achievement in the film industry. Then I saw Avatar..The word ""wow"" doesn't begin to describe this masterpiece. First, let me start out by saying that the script was NOT bad. It wasn't superb either, like LOTR or the other classics, it was just good. However, with the added graphics, it became great.A lot of people complain about Cameron's propaganda in this movie and that's alright. However, if Cameron's main idea was to get his propaganda across, he failed miserably. He should have made an average movie to get people to listen"". Instead, he made the most revolutionary film in the history of movies, and I doubt anyone really paid attention to his ""message"".The romance and chemistry between the cgi Jake Sully and Ney'tiri was in my mind, on the level of Jack and Rose in Titanic, or any of the greatest romances in movie history. Furthermore, as a conservative, it was easy for me to cheer for the underdog natives in this film. I wouldn't really use it as an allegory for native Americans or any of the other wars, because that would be ignorant.In conclusion, this movie was ""it"". It may not be The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, or the Green Mile, but it was easily the most entertaining movie I have EVER seen, and I've seen it 3 times already. Everyone get out there and watch it. James Cameron is the best."
"I am gob-smacked that serious film critics have gone ga-ga over this mess. The only reason I didn't walk out was I knew there was a big punch-up coming at the end which would pull out all the stops.I haven't seen any of the big films which have been screened in 3-D before this one. The scenes in the forest with all the flora and fauna get the most benefit from being filmed in 3-D. But I saw more effective 3- D when I was a kid, or at an Imax screening before Imax started showing regular films in addition to its scientific ones.At no point during ""Avatar"" did I duck reflexively--which is what's great about 3-D because you think a ball is going to hit you, or a car is hurtling towards you. This looked more like a moving version of a diorama or a 3-D card or photo printed on rutted plastic-coated cardboard.The script was terrible--a vomit-inducing blend of faux scientific gobbledegook and new age, airy-fairy nonsense. That bizarre merging of the characters with animals and each other via their braids (don't ask!) was sexual but in a very, very creepy way,I can't wait for the idiots who start learning the made up language in time for the next ComicCon or the first ""Avatar"" convention.Head over to the nearest Home Depot and start working on those tails!"
"This movie has nothing we haven't seen before, and the fact it was made in stunning 3d doesn't help it much. The onset is quite promising, but from there it starts going steadily downhill. ""Avatar"" employs every adventure-movie cliché: a tough guy learns the spiritual ways of the tribe that accepts him as a member, the white people are greedy and evil, and, of course, the goodness and justice prevails against all odds. And ever since we learn of the feat that only few tribe members accomplished to date, we know that the protagonist is bound to accomplish it as well. For better treatment, go see: ""A Man Called Horse"", or read ""Lord of the Rings"" (the book, not the movie)."
"OK, let me make it 100% clear that I'm a Cameron fan..Big time. But this film is cliché-heavy as hell....And it has 'by-the-numbers' dialogue that'll make you cringe if you're over 10 yrs old. Like the other negative reviews (of actual substance, not the ones that stoop to racial attacks, honestly, ""whigger power-fantasy? a**hole) I have to agree that the story is so unoriginal it borders on B-movie level entertainment with an overblown budget.Regardless of your politics, this move kinda bites...It lacks any sophistication in the dynamics with the characters...they're just stereotypes and templates for the CGI to dance around...Matrix, Dances with Wolves, Disney flick, and Aliens thrown into a blender with a computer and BAM, you have Avatar..."
"In the future, humans have traveled to the far reaches of the universe. On a planet called Pandora, a very important new element was discovered, one that is very valuable. But, wouldn't you know, the natives on the planet live in the forest, where most of the element is located, underground. It is the human intention to ""displace"" the natives out of their woods and get to the mineral. For years, the Americans have occupied an outpost on the planet and have tried peaceful methods to reason with the aliens. The top scientist, Grace (Sigourney Weaver) learned their language and opened a ""school"" to teach the native children English and the ways of the human. But, the Pandoran population truly wants none of it, for they rightly feel that their world will be destroyed. Although they have only bows and arrows, with a killing poison attached, they are very fierce. As a last resort, the Marines are trying a program of elaborate ""robots"", where an earthling goes into a sort of capsule and sleeps while his ""soul"" inhabits a native body. It is their hope that learning the ways of the natives will make them easier to ""conquer"" and move. Now, a wheelchair-bound Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) gets a new, Pandoran body and goes with Grace and a few others on a mission. But, due to some fierce dinosaur-like creatures, Jake becomes separated from the others and is left in the forest at night. Grace believes he will surely die. He would have, too, for a powerful female warrior, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) was set to shoot him. But, some seeds from their ""tree of life"" cover Jake and Neytiri sees it as an omen. She takes Jake back to her village where he is eventually accepted as a tribesman. He learns to ride the native ""horses"" and ""dragons"". He and Neytiri also fall in love. But, during the night, Jake ""reports"" back to the Marines when his native body is asleep. The marine commander believes he is gathering information to defeat the primitive folk. As one might guess, Jake soon realizes his new people are very worthy and should not be destroyed or moved, for their life is ""connected"" deeply to the forest, their home. What will Jake do to save Neytiri and his new brothers and sisters? This is an amazing film, a stunningly visual panorama that has to be seen to be believed. The planet of Pandora is a forest like no other, with plants that ""glow"" and creatures that resemble dinosaurs, wolves, and dragons. The natives, too, resemble the American Indian and other earthly tribes, such as the residents of the Amazon rain forests. Most importantly, they are ""attached"" to their planet as the Native Americans were to the earth. When they kill an animal for food, they utter prayers to the animal for giving his life so that they might be sustained. They consider the destruction of any plant a blow to their own bodies. Thus, in many respects, the movie is a gigantic homage to the American Indian and their way of life. Wes Studi, who was the ultra frightening Native American in The Last of the Mohicans, even plays the Pandoran leader. But, enough of this. The actors, including Worthington, Weaver, Saldana, Ribisi, Stephen Lang and all of the rest do a fine job. The dialogue and story are, perhaps, not totally original but quite, quite adequate. However, even all these take a back seat to the incredibly imaginative scope of the film's setting, a new world far away. It is the grand scale of the forested planet that will take a viewer's breath away. In short, dear film fan, see it. Absolutely, if you can go to only ONE film this year or next, make it AVATAR. It is truly a jaw-dropping work that will overwhelm most anyone with its visionary beauty."
"The colorful sometimes imaginative world of Avatar is firmly rooted in the Hollywood tradition of allowing white average people to play Indian or go native. Be it the Last Samurai, Lawerence of Arabia or Dances with Wolves there is a long tradition of films that fill the dual fantasy of leaving ones race. I say dual fantasy because they always come in with a new package but the end result is always the same. First a white person of little merit (Lawerence was a mild mannered clerk and hobby orientalist, Tom Cruise's samurai a drunk)and now our hero in Avatar bound to a wheel chair and by all accounts a moron.Warning Spoiler!!! Somehow however he manages to become chief of the blue people by the end of the big screen video game.So we get the two pillars of the leaving your race sub-genre, pillar one, one can leave their race and be something other and exotic, and two any ole white guy given the chance can master another language, (though very few do in truth in America) an ancient complicated culture, and end up ruling or above the lowly natives. Makes one wonder which white supremacist enclave cranked this flimsy excuse for a script out in the first place.Even if we can accept this tale as mere fantasy (though it seems heavy handed and more of a fable) One can not escape the fact that this film even in 3d imax can not fool us into thinking we have entered a realm of flesh and blood water and stone. It never rises above its computer generated nature, that is to say tricking us into asking, ""wow how did they do that?"" or ""gosh that looks so real it must be some real place somewhere."" Instead as folks were leaving the theater and being asked by those waiting in a snowy line, ""how was it?"" the comments were always the same ""the graphics were great."" Failure point blank, if that is all one can say of it then it is has failed in its efforts to transport the audience to another time and place where we are lost and go for a ride with the cast and crew. In truth I seldom even thought that the graphics were in fact great.The technology and violence are filmed with such relish one might be confused as to the ultimate message of the film are we to enjoy or hate such violence and weaponry? I suspect everyone who is giving this film an eight to ten rating and raving about it as the future of cinema, will be red faced when as it was with Titanic, they watch this steamy mess on video and realize, what clumsy, half baked and shallow film making Avatar really is."
"Unfortunately, over the last few years the Hollywood industry has moved from entertaining your brains to entertaining your eyes. So now zillions of dollars are spent on beautiful 3D visuals with 1D characters inhabiting them.A black and white hackney story about indigenous people fighting against hi-tech intruders serves as a bleak background for nice and shiny CGI animation. No wonder most of the character are CGI as there is no need to act. Pretty impressive show but you better not to ask yourself ""what was this movie about?""Nothing, just entertainment. We produce microchips and then sell images generated by them.."
"I know several people have asked me for my take on Avatar and I try not to disappoint my faithful readers. Avatar is the worst movie ever made. It has groundbreaking 3-D special effects, but after awhile, they can't cover up the thin plot that is your typical recycled story that they borrowed from Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai, and Brian's Song. Action takes place on the planet Pandora, where a bunch of 10 foot tall blue aliens live. This is where the lead character winds up. At first, he goes there to infiltrate the aliens, but eventually he goes native. OK, first of all this is the worst movie i have ever seen, just visuals why fight the blue people just throw 2 or 3 nuclear bombs on them it is a common stupid the story is predictable, the action is stupid and animation is like ice cream people, 150 years into future, the hero is still on an old mechanic wheelchair, just stupid the movie is boring"
"Well, maybe it deserves a few more, but I have to challenge the overall rating which is far too high for this load of crap. I actually did not get any mind blowing experience even in the field of visuals. All the creatures, blue monkeys (well, that was a nice line from the ""bad guy""), trees and stuff looks great, but in a way of a fairy tale not ""the other world"" or smth. This movie looks like made under influence of magic mushrooms or substances with similar effects. And all the visuals couldn't drag away my attention from the fact that there was unoriginal story, weak plot, cheap ""face"" shots and editing which comes with every average action flick in the past decades. Actually, I had a lot of time to think of this during the movie and that is not a good thing. To say it in one line, this movie is Jurassic Park of our decade (no offence to Dino fans), only worse."
"I saw the 3D version of this movie and at times was literally blown away. Amazing and never before done visuals, it must be said. However, in my judgment, the visuals could not make up for an annoyingly predictable story and stereotypical characters. At times I felt like the script had been copied from a (bad) 2,5 hour long episode of the smurfs. The story is very PC, but in the most annoying way. Hollywood's take on being progressive means that they either whip out the image of the noble savage or that they draw a (very, very) obvious parallel between a war and the wars fought by the US. Didn't the same movie makers use to promote blind patriotism? Anyway, maybe i'm taking this too far but to me the movie seemed like a one dimensional movie, and no 3D expensive visuals could make up for that. Too bad."
"I finally saw this film over the weekend. I am a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, so why did I wait to see it? After all the Hollywood hype I figured (correctly) that this film was all bark and no bite. The story started off great, but once the forest scenes started it was seeming all to familiar, Dances with Wolves all over again, just with blue aliens. Except in repeat mode it was even worse. It became very evident that the intent of this film was to box up all of the ""evil"" ideologies of our society and wrap them up in a kid flick to further brainwash our society. There were so many ""unbelievable"" ideas (even in a Hollywood fantasy) that I could not take any more. A networked environment of beings, plants and animals like some sort of living internet? Floating pieces of earth with waterfalls that come from no where, I guess gravity does not exist there? Some mineral (unobtainium? give me a break) that we have no idea what it is. They did not even show this stuff and we are supposed be believe that it is worth exterminating an entire race for? What was happening on earth that demanded this war? I felt like I was back on Endor with the Ewoks. The General even had scars like Anakin Skywalker as Darth Vader. Cameron should have just put him in a black cape. There was absolutely nothing original about this film, very unfortunate. James Cameron used to be a pillar in the sci-fi genre. To make it worse it that the CGI was not that great, the mixing of live action made it very apparent what was real and what was animated. This film should have been done 100% in CGI and sold as a kid flick. I just don't get where the great reviews are coming from? I actually fast forwarded through much of the overdrawn ""utopian"" scenes. James should have just called the planet Utopia instead of Pandora, how original would that be? If you are planning on seeing the film just do not expect to know or care for any of the characters, understand what it is they are fighting for and give up all notions of general relativity as we know it. Just sit back and choke down all of Cameron's blatant rip-offs."
"For a movie that made a billion dollars, AVATAR was a huge disappointment. Visually, it's stunning. I didn't get to see the 3D version, but the 2D looked stunning nonetheless. With that said, I have to wonder:1) The film takes place in the future, the computers and hand-held devices are all touch-screen, but the main character is using a non-motorized wheelchair? Nobody could spring for a Hoveround? And I would think there would've been a cure to his paralyzed legs in the future.2) So in order to be welcomed by the Na'vi tribe, you must have a bunch of floating dandelions land on you and chant/pray to a jellyfish tree?3) The Na'vi plug their braids into animals to bond? And the braids have tentacles? Ewwww!4) Out of all the leading men to choose from, they had to cast Eric Bana 2.0? The lead actor was more wooden than the Hometree.5) The Colonel seemed like a cross between John McCain, Clint Eastwood, and Donald Rumsfeld when stating their mission to fight the known unknowns...I mean, the Na'vi. 6) What's with Sigourney Weaver smoking like a chimney? You could practically smell the tobacco after a while. Surprised that she did set off a smoke alarm.7) So the Na'vi have to fight the faux Millenuim Falcon, numerous helicopters with two fans attached to each one, a bunch of Optimus Prime wannabes, and some miniature Master Chiefs?8) Seriously, two hours and forty-five minutes? The length wouldn't be so bad if there was a better script to follow.9) You have scientists and the military working side by side in Pandora. Talk about a recipe for disaster.10) Yes, the effects are great but when the characters are either stereotypical and/or bland, it's hard to care about anyone.11) Special effects and 3D can never, ever compensate for a bad, predictable script that rips off everything from STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS, DISTRICT 9, POCAHONTAS, DANCING WITH WOLVES.12) If I want to watch politics, I'll watch MSNBC. I want a movie to entertain me, not preach to me.13) She has a nice voice, but Leona Lewis is no Celine Dion. And the song itself is just as bland."
"I wanted to walk out of the theater when i saw this movie. I can sum it up as a certain Disney animated movie from the early nineties, with blue people, 3-D, and an awful story. I cannot believe how many people like this movie it amazes me. I sat through the worst two plus hours in cinema history. That fact that he spent over 500 million dollars and ten years on a movie and this is it, wow! To go along with the great movie was some of the worst acting i have ever scene the bad guy? can you say cheesy. There is so much wrong with this movie but i hope that i don't have to explain it all and you can see it with your own eyes. I would even recommend Jonah hex over this. And i hated that movie.Don't expect me to ever see a Cameron movie again."
"Avatar tried to be epic for the sake of being epic. What is really was, was obnoxiously long and boring.It is very apparent that people (as a whole) are slaves, liking what is fashionable to like and being caught up in effects. The evidence of this is when you ask someone what they thought of it and the 1st thing they say is ""the effects were so awesome"". It is not uncommon to hear no mention of any other aspect of the movie at all, just how cool the effects were. So once the 1st few people come out and say this is one of the best movies ever, others won't buck that opinion. I will.The plot was thin. Very thin. And completely un-unique. Basically, bad guys fight good guys, good guys get smashed but against all odds fight back and eventually win. The most annoying thing about these kind of movies is that the director tries to make you feel good at the end of the movie because the goodies eventually beat the baddies. What they won't do is focus on how much loss the goodies had to have to actually win. So in the case of Avatar, i don't think the indigenous would actually care so much about winning in the end, because they lost their mother tree and most of what they lived for anyway.The sub plot was just as bad and unoriginal. In fact, it followed the simplistic romantic comedy plot. Basically, a man is asked to deceive a girl (in this case other people as well), then he falls in love with the girl, then the girl finds out he was only there to deceive her and hates him, then they work things out and live happily every after.The effects were cool (in parts) but completely overdone. So was the whole movie for that matter. The 1st two thirds of the movie could have been cut in half (at least). Whilst the effects were cool, revolving a movie around how cool you make something look is not a good way to make a reputable movie.The 3D was lame. People will look back on this in 10 or 15 years time and laugh. We will wonder why we ever accepted putting a set of glasses on to enhance a movie. But even on its merits now, it is still terrible. It is difficult to focus at times and the clarity was impaired (especially around the sides). I had to take the glasses off for a good portion of the movie just to avoid getting a headache. Forgetting my personal gripes about the 3D glasses, logically it is a pretty simple equation when you consider how bad the technology is in the glasses. You spend hundreds of thousands on cameras to shoot the movie, you spend tens of thousands on a projector and then you view the final product through a set of $1 glasses! No professional photographer spends thousands on a camera and lenses then spends $10 on a cheap filter and nor should anyone be watching a HD movie through a $1 set of glasses.It is a good indication that the movie has not done it's job if after 2.5 hours of watching it you find yourself not caring whether the main character lives of dies, you just want it to happen so the movie will end. This is how i felt at the end of Avatar.I have some smaller gripes that are worth mentioning, but they alone did not make the movie suck. They certainly didn't help either. Although the movie was not all action, the action it did have was average. Any action that has to be slowed down to show how special it is isn't worth showing (ala the Maxtrix). I know the General was a tough man, but i'm doubtful whether he could pull a sword out of his neck like it was never there to begin with. I'm not convinced that a flux vortex is anything more than a 'Back To The Future' rip off. The money James Cameron used to make this movie could have been spent to educate and assist with the very problems he was referring to in the movie. But he wanted an excuse to WOW people with effects.It wasn't all bad. The effects were cool, the scenery was nice and the 3D was subtle and not overpowering (ala the insects flying in front of you every now and then).If you were going into a cool presentation for 20minutes you would leave very satisfied. If you went in expecting a movie you would walk out after 2.5hrs very unsatisfied."
"I just saw the movie in IMAX 3D. I can't believe the movie ended in 3 hours. The movie is so captivating that you want the story to continue. Hats off to James Cameron! Now that I am outside the movie hall. I just feel like I am missing something. Call it special effects or what ever. The night life of Pandora was simply breathtaking. The florescent effects were marvelous. The flora and the fauna of Pandora were quite intriguing, especially the plant which closes in on touching. Mountains floating in the air, though Newton wouldn't have agreed, but it would rather be amazing to live in such world. The story takes you to another dimension. There's no doubt that I'm gonna watch the movie again. But I'm just out of luck, since movie tickets aren't available. I believe the long break which James Cameron took after Titanic, was worth it. The movie deserves more than 8.5 IMDb rating."
"I honestly think it is sad that James Cameron really didn't think he needed to write good material just because the animation is so good in Avatar. The movie gets one star from me for that. And the movie is so long, the animation didn't even matter that much by the end.I also think it is sad that people don't even care for something better written.Seriously, this has to be one of the most nonsensical, holes in plot, unoriginal, clichéd movie i have ever seen.I am not asking for masterpiece theatre here, but come on Mr. Cameron, did you stop learning how to write in grade three, and just learn how to make movies from there on? This has to be one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen."
"First let me say that I was very very exited for Avatar I expected an outstanding movie with an original plot,good characters and of course outstanding visuals. I was so exited that I drove out of town to see it. Boy was I disappointed.This movie was poorly acted was really cheesy and had one of the most overused plots ever and that's where I had a real problem with this movie this movie doesn't even try to be original. Right down to the bows and arrows this movie is basically Pocahontas just with aliens. While many will claim that avatar is a retelling or it's using that story to convey a deeper message but no it is still Pocahontas.Don't Believe me? Look a little deeper. Jake Sully(john smith) is a marine(explorer) going to Pandora(America) to look for Silver(that mineral whatever it is called). He happens to come across the tribes princess Neytiri(Pocahantas) and although she initially distrusts him the mother tree(mother willow) tells her to teach him the ways of their people. They soon fall in love however Jake Sully(john Smith)'s band of Marines(explorers) come and force Jake sully(john smith) to choose the girl he loves or his country. I am fine with retelling of old stories but this is too close to Pocahontas to call original.This movie is now the second most grossing movie of all time and likely to surpass titanic as #1. This movie teaches directors that to make money you just need it to look cool you don't need interesting characters or a new story you just need amazing visuals.The only thing I learned from Avatar is that if I need 1 billion dollars I will just recreate Aladdin with aliens and as long as it looks cool people will love it.Remember Sh*t wrapped in shiny foil is still sh*t and no matter how shiny it looks it still smells."
"When this film was first advertised on TV, I saw clips from it and decided that this looked like a promising movie. It then went on to make a record breaking box office total, and a friend of mine said it was amazing. I became excited for this film. Then, others told me that it was overrated. It was just a ripoff of Pocahontas that was shielded by brilliant graphics. I didn't let that opinion get to me though; I still kept an open mind. Eventually, when I got the DVD, I began to watch it excitedly. It started off strongly; the storyline held promise, and the special effects were amazing. Then, I got to the forest scene, and the graphics were nothing sort of gorgeous. The world of Pandora was definitely one that I wanted to touch. I wanted to be there. It was unfortunate at this very moment that an advancement in the storyline ruined this sense of wonder about the movie. The moment when the elder aboriginal leader said, ""Alright, you will learn our ways"", and the title characters started to spend time together, I right away predicted where the story was going. This was the moment that ruined the movie for me. It fell into a cliché trap. At this point, I lost full interest in seeing the rest of the film, and I did not bother finishing it. A film can look visually stunning, but in the end, what counts is the storyline. If your plot isn't strong, then the film will not work. No matter how good the film looks, visuals can never make up for a weak script. I'll sum up by saying that this film was, in my opinion, overrated. It held so much promise for me, but all that died."
"Avatar has a reputation for being the biggest movie ever. There is no denying it's tremendous success. I really had no interest in seeing this at all, but the huge success had me curious. Maybe this was worth checking out.Or maybe not.A hell of a lot of people like this or love this, but I am going against the grain. Avatar is nothing special. Despite it's sheer beauty and excellent effects, this is a very boring movie that is predictable and a cliché ridden mess. Think, hero gets into avatar, hero goes to world, hero infiltrates, hero meets girl, hero falls for girl, and If you had seen as many movies as I have then you should be thinking how long it is before the obvious time where girl finds out about hero's original plan for cliché conflict.There's more, the cliché tough military guy who just wants to kill everything without remorse, the suit who is uncaring played very poorly by a complete miscast Giovanni Ribisi, The one who turns against the EVIL humans to side with the REAL GOOD guys, the slow motion battle sequence with faded noise and music to deliver ""emotion"", The hero feeling bad about himself, the final battle with the evil bad guy, hero proves himself to the ones he wronged, ugh......this is a lot of em.I am so sick of clichés.Must I forget about the very obvious political message here? James Cameron took a direct shot at former President George W. Bush. I do not care where you stand on what political platform, but please leave your bullshit politics out of the movies and just make a movie that is all about escape.Bottom line, this movie was like landing a date with a very beautiful babe, you start off excited, then you begin talking and she is kinda dull, then as the night rolls on, she gets more boring and by the end, you just want to politely end the evening and not date her again because she bores you to death and is clearly not your type, despite her beauty being her only saving grace.Nothing too see here people, nothing too see here please!"
"Along with every other late first-time viewer, I expect we had inflated expectations based on media hype and word-of-mouth. Most of the characters are so two-dimensional I expected them to disappear when they turned sideways. An exception is Sigourney Weaver's character; she got some of the best lines (at least the most of the laughs, wry or otherwise, from us), but isn't she yet tired of playing the star-crossed heroine fighting an alien force?The problem here is the story, or lack thereof. From the get-go, every major plot twist is not just foreshadowed but pointed to with big flashing neon signs reading ""WATCH FOR THIS IN A FUTURE SCENE"". The dialogue is often wooden (some of the worst lines are actually quoted in IMDb's ""Memorable Quotes"" section for the film); I heard nothing that reminded me of really good quotes from films like Aliens. The bad aliens/good locals is played as though the audience is completely new to the concept of the history of conquering invaders and downtrodden natives; contrast this with the really funny send-up of over-the-top PC sensitivity early on in Imaginarium, when the bobby has trouble working out how to refer to Verne Troyer's character. The lack of imagination (or intentional references to Native Americans) in using human-like natives with human-like voices and emotional responses is unfortunate; more interesting aliens were developed in The Abyss.The special effects are very good, although the small-frame 3D glasses used at our local theater really felt awkward and got in the frame of the projected image. The owl-eye polarized lenses used at other IMAX theaters were much more pleasant to use. I recall a better experience with Coraline's 3D projection, but I don't recall which style of glasses were used. The 3D visuals were nice, but they were abused by overuse–no opportunity to highlight the 3Dness of the film was left on the virtual cutting room floor. I would have been much happier with better dialogue, more story, and less special effects.It's not a bad film, and if one is interested in 3D CGI, this should be seen in a theater with the proper equipment (preferably one with large, polarized lenses). But if you've seen The Polar Express, you've seen a better film–story, acting, dialogue–than Avatar, and with 3D effects that better support the story and are not the only reason for seeing the movie. But I can't recommend it to anyone who is not dead-set on seeing it in 3D."
"(Contains Spoilers!!!)For myself to describe this film I could end up writing a book as to how the amazing James Cameron came about making this jaw dropping movie but I will keep it briefFrom the outset as the movie starts by showing outer space, we know that he starts resembling to older sci-fi movies such as Blade Runner, Aliens, etc. But we see so much more when the world of Pandora is shown in front of us. The world is such an exotic place, it makes me wish that it actually existed because the 3D effects of this movie will never be matched by acclaimed movie makers such as Christopher Nolan, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg; this movie is in a league of its own, overall the effects will change the way we watch movies. I've read reviews that the plot is weak but when you are submerged into the world of Pandora you forget that, it's like you just wanna get up of your seat and jump into the world of Pandora, the detail has been done right down to little insects which look breath taking and so realistic, that's how good Mr. Cameron has made this movieOverall, the movie should make a cash loads of money but believe the movie will be in my view the best movie of 2009 and my best movie of all time, I think the amount of work that James Cameron has done is just amazing and it makes you think that why can't a world like a world of Pandora really exist?The acting is amazing - despite some cheesy scenes near the end but in my view I would love to see the beautiful Zoe Saldana get nominated for Best Supporting Actress, she was just amazing and brought so much to the roleVerdict: Amazingly jaw dropping effects which will make you wanna see the movie more than once just so you can see the wonders of Pandora(Going to go and see it again)"
"Yes, I gave this film a 1. Yes, the visuals were great. So are a lot of visuals on video games. These movies shouldn't get a pass if the visuals are good. I can go back to the original Star Wars. The visuals were not that great, but at least the movie was fun and had a great story.Like others have said, this movie applies the most basic plot. Us against them. You have seen this in films like Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai. It all the basic themes and nothing else. You are just hammered with a bunch of crying and boo-woo and tribal singing and dancing. This can be an OK concept. I actually liked the Last Samurai. Guy joins the tribe and he is eventually accepted. But there was more there. There was the capable use of Bow and Arrow against forces with guns. But the good guys eventually lost because they were outnumbered. Kind of makes sense.In Avatar, I just don't care that much for the blue people. At first they were pretty arrogant. Jake was this close to being hit by a bow and arrow. I also thought they accepted him pretty easily. There really wasn't a reason. He just kind of joined. Here is a guy that doesn't speak the language, has some kind of foreign connection is down right awkward. Accepting him can't possibly go wrong? Right? They then accept him and reject him and accept him again. He gets accepted kind of quickly and easily passes all of the dumb-down initiation tests. (imagine that). There is nothing really compelling about the blue people Na'Vi culture except for their connection with the environment. They are connected but to what extent. They can talk to the other animals? The trees? Why are we supposed to fall in love with them because of that. Because they use primitive weapons? Towards the end of the movie, I was actually rooting for the humans. Why? Because there never really was a case they were bad. Sure, they went after the Na'Vi's main tree. That is bad, but Cameron never really tells us why. So, for all we know, killing the tree was pretty important to the movie. There was mention about the Pandora ore, supposedly it was very expensive. That is all we here mention of for blowing up the tree. For all we know, that expensive ore could have saved billions on earth. The plot is so dumbed-down, I didn't really care. But, the humans had better weapons, so I just hoped they could pull it off. And of course, this would be impossible even though they had more advanced technology. The blue people have to win.So yea, this is another Hollywood farce that will get a lot of good reviews. But all those reviews will be based on the visuals and nothing more."
"Avatar is an important cinematic achievement. To dismiss its groundbreaking visual effects is just as bad as forgiving its lack of plot development and weak dialog. The movie will usher in a new era, for good or bad, of technical achievement in film. The 3-D is amazing and the special effects are on a scale that Lucas could have only dreamed about. But, like Lucas in his prequels, so much time is spent depicting the story that (it seems) no one really bothered to ask if the story was worth telling to begin with. Imagine if Avatar had been as powerful as 2001. Imagine if the story were just as awe inspiring as the images racing before your eyes. That would have been a true movie masterpiece. Because, in the end, no matter how good the movie looks, the visuals only exist to bring the story to life."
"I cannot believe the amount of hype surrounding this film, the special effects, CGI and visuals are good, but thats about it really. The script is boring and predictable, as is the plot and the acting is as amateur as could be (apart from Zoe Saldana, who i thought gave her character a bit of depth). The main actor, Sam Worthington (I think he's called) is TERRIBLE, I immediately hated his marine character mainly because of the shallowness he portrays on the screen and his inability to have an ounce of charisma or warmth, strangely enough though I didn't hate his blue character as much, and actually at some points in the film, I liked him...a bit.Overall Avatar is heavily overrated, the incredibly long fight scene at the end was just plain boring, the script was normal (there was nothing special about it) and overall I just felt the film lacked warmth."
"if you never seen a 3d movie, and all you care is 3d experience then this is a good start! If you are looking for a movie with story/plot/characters/excitement then this movie has nothing for you!This is just another 3d movie. All the hype/euphoria seems to be pumped by the producers to make sure they get back their 400million + some more $$ i don't understand what was directors contribution to the movie? if LOTR was made 3d it would be a gazillion times better! I just wish i never wasted 160+mins and $15 for the 3d version of avatar! Really disappointed with Cameron's! never gonna watch his stuff again.Now watch him come up with couple of more avatars and much the hell out of them thru media to make sure everyone watches them."
"I've already seen this movie. It was called ""Battle for Terra,"" got a very low-profile release a few months back, and was better. Same movie, only less pretentious, less padded out, and with more ambiguous morality (aliens clearly imperfect in their own way). Also, where ""Battle for Terra"" concerned itself more with the theme of using technology wisely, and respecting the rights of other cultures, ""Avatar"" was just outright Luddite, which seems horribly hypocritical for a MOVIE. Its certainly beautiful, but the 3-D, while better than most, is still migraine-inducing more often than it is cool. If you really want to see it for the visuals, I'd say rent it."
"This movie did not live up to the hype and it made me doubt that James Cameron has any sensibility. The story is stupid. The characters are ridiculous. The creatures are laughable. The movie is for the most part boredom. If the movie was 60 minutes long it would have been better. The acting is flat at it's best. The CG is like something from a made for TV movie. The 3D turned me off from 3D for an entire year. It hurts me to know that there is going to be a sequel to this crapfest. Two and a half hours of my life wasted on what turns out to be a giant metaphor for deforestation. Go watch a Ridley Scott film and you'll have spent your time as best you can in the science fiction genre. Actually, even Heaven's Gate is better and it's not even science fiction. And that movie was an abortion of entertainment."
"""Avatar"" is THE most overrated film for (atleast) the last 10 years. The plot? It's basically ""Pocahontas goes to Space"". Sure, the effects is outstanding - but that's it. The only good thing I remember from watching this movie is the effects. The acting is horrible, the story is horrible (to much 'save the rain forest' hippie/new age crap). The last time James Cameron actually did something REALLY good was that movie.. Hmm.. What's it called.. Oh yeah: T2. Too much focus on effects - not to much focus on the story. Come on, Mr. Cameron.. You KNOW you can do better than this.Would I recommend this over-hyped movie? No. Do I still think people should see it? Yes. For the effects."
"where to start? the unoriginal ideas? stereotypical acting? racial profiling? (in my opinion). overall the whole movie is a simple piece of unoriginal crap. the only thing that makes it worth watching is the visual effects. a true embarrassment for the amazing James Cameron and all science fiction films out there. the combination of one liners, simple characters and predictability make this film truly disastrous. not to mention. maybe i was the only one but when i watched the extended version there were scenes of (alien) buffalo hunting and even dancing around a fire and acting like idiots! such scenes led me to think of racial profiling. overall, the film a a massive smelting pot of cruddy embarrassment."
"I can not stand this movie. In my fictional list of most hated movies, Avatar is ranked numero uno. Don't get me wrong, in a cinematic view, it's not that bad. It's not garbage, it IS stomachable.. but it was definitely not good or ""brilliant"". Actually sub par is a good way to describe it. It was a let down considering how much hype this movie gets.How can i hate a movie that is a tad under average? well my hatred of this movie stems from the fact that everyone think's it is a masterpiece, and the sad part is, i think half of these fanboys only like it because they're supposed to like it. I could sit here all day and list reasons why this movie is garbage, but instead i'll just leave you with a quote from my English teacher before every power point assignment: ""Visuals and extras do not make a powerpoint, content does- don't waste your time with special effects, animations, background, or transitions until your message is perfected."""
"$300 million-plus Big Screen video game run amuck; pretty much sums it up, don't it? Cameron, clearly a fan of Robert Heinlein (STARSHIP TROOPERS), Joe Haldeman (ALL MY SINS REMEMBERED), and Harlan Ellison (SOLDIER, DEMON WITH A GLASS HAND), has actually managed, this time around, to incorporate THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS into his Big Screen video game. How's THAT for juxtaposition...? Unfortunately, the end result is something less than satisfying (unless, of course, you have the constitution to sit through a 3-hour-long video game, couched in the usual clichéd military setting- which I don't). On a somewhat related note, I found out the hard way (by first purchasing and then watching it) that the ""director's cut"" of George Lucas's THX-1138 had been TAMPERED with: spankin' new cgi have been added that undercut the gritty realism that made the ""original version"" so much better. There is at least one reference to a ""wookie"" being run over (yuk-yuk) and the in-bred trolls who attack Duvall at movie's end have been replaced by unconvincing cgi monsters. Maybe, one of these days, filmmakers will learn to leave well enough alone- but I doubt it."
"What a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing this last night. Several people recommended it. I was going to wait for a three-D opportunity to see it, but figured, ""Why not tonight?"" Typical Cameron techno-military setup, and here we see Weaver again. Okay. Good start. Then the Pandorans are introduced. Tall and lanky, just like NBA basketball players. Hmm. Okay. Then the guy gets on Pandora as a Pandoran, and starts to get chased around by cartoon monsters in a preposterous fluorescent world. Hmm, What's next? Then the Pandoran babe shows up, and they both start running through the colorful woods....that was it. End of show for me. Just another high-tech Clutch Cargo episode. Minus Paddlefoot.Three stars for effort."
"If you combine Dances with wolves, Pocahontas, with really cool FX then you get Avatar. Very predictable. Very unoriginal. 2 of my friends and i during the movie kept on pointing out things that seem unimportant early on, at one moment gain significant importance. The only really redeeming factor is the FX. Only see this movie in 3D, otherwise don't bother.I only gave this movie a 2 because of the amazing FX. Many people will say how wrong i am and how amazing this movie is and how it is the best movie of all time. hopefully these people only watched it and didn't listen to it."
"First off, I know this review is well after the movie came out. Second, I did like the movie due to the special effects.Now, the real info: this movie outright copied themes characters animals and ideas from numerous films, book, and video games. lets start with the easiest to identify.The Osprey-like aircraft, identical to pelicans in Halo video game series.The different creatures in the film - I am a big fan of John Norman's Gor series. Virtually ALL of the creatures in this film were stolen from the description of creatures in John Norman's books, the six legged tharlarian, the tarns (just took away the feathers), the six legged sleen - I could just keep going.The home tree - Ferngully.The robot suits...hmmmm....let me think...Aliens? Oh, and they even matched the ones from Matrix even more.Unobtanium - The Core.I could continue to go on, but I don't like rambling. Just suffice it to say that anything you point out in the movie, I can tell you where it was stolen from.Again, I liked the movie, just wish he could have used his own imagination rather than steal from so many others."
"I finally got to see Avatar on HBO this weekend. I can only imagine what the movie looked like on the big screen. I realize that the impact of this type of movie can only be felt when watching in a theater. However, a great movie will come through as great in any format. This is hardly a great movie. Other reviewers have provided a perfect description of Avatar as Dances with Wolves in space. I cannot agree more. I am a hard-core environmentalist, but this simplistic plot filled with cartoon characters is an insult. The acting is frequently embarrassing. The ""bad"" guys are such a weak caricature of the US military going to Vietnam that one could only think that James Cameron forgot he made Aliens. I think he subconsciously did a mash-up of Aliens, Dances with Wolves, and The Abyss when attempting to be adventurous with special effects. If I wanted great effects with a weak story, I could stand behind a great player of Halo or Call of Duty. James Cameron should hire a screenwriter before he comes up with his next big idea. Decades from now, viewers will be mystified how this movie broke box office records."
"Lets start with the one real praise in I have for the film, it is beautiful, the special effects are very good and the film is a visual treat. Apart from that I can't understand the hype. The plot has been done before and in my mind better, the storyline was very predictable and the acting was average. I didn't feel like the move was engaging and because of this I felt every minute of a film which seemed to forget how to end. And I'm not a man who minds long films, I'd quite happily sit through 9hours of paint drying then watch a minute of Avatar. Don't get me started on the events of a film, is just wrong, when the two main characters get intimate there ponytails are required in the act. These are the same ponytails used to connect to animals and a big tree. Call me old fashioned but that is unnatural and if it wasn't shown through fancy CGI it wouldn't be able to be shown on and cinema screen. Also what was up with that 3D I liked the fact that it didn't just have things popping out into your face, but I'd like to notice it, the 3D was so noninvasive Cameron might as well not bothered.Another thing what was up with the extended addition released, it had 9 extra minutes what sort of person would buy another ticket for 9 minutes. Also Cameron is planning a second and third film, good milking the money tree.(I don't know how you'd milk a tree).I do have to give it to James Cameron not everyone could convince a film company to give him stupid amount of money to throw away money on special effects and CGI to hold together a pitiful story, which seriously an 8 year old could have written and make the whole world rave about it.If you want to watch a film with Green living references I recommend Ferngully the Last Rainforest, it had a more compelling and original story, and has Robbin Williams as a sinning bat classic. In short I can't understand. Do people no longer want to see good, interesting stories, told through actors who demand you focus and hold you glued to the screen or is it CGI that wins the masses."
"Tried to see Avatar opening weekend on the IMAX 3D but sold out. Saw it on a regular screen. Since then I was at lunch with some friends from school and all they kept talking about was the way it looked so real in 3D and how they felt like they were surrounded by the 3D flakes, and how the Avatar world and it's inhabitants looked so real, and how it didn't feel like CGI and so on. I wanted to jump in and be part of the conversation but I felt like I missed out because I didn't get the 3d IMAX experience. So I went this week and saw it in all it's glory in the 3D IMAX, and I realized something. I thought it was definitely cool, all the special effects and all that technical stuff, but then I realized something half way through the movie–it's a regurgitation of the story of Pocahontas, with the names changed to protect the innocent. I thought to myself, this movie is a revolutionary step in film making as far as special effects, but the story isn't. That disappointed me. How come film makers or Hollywood don't have an original thought? Don't get me wrong, once in a while something will go to the independent theaters that gives us something new. But why, even in a movie with so much special effects planning and all, do they still have to steal from another story? End of the day, if you are going to see Avatar, it's a must see on the 3D IMAX screen. And the execution of the movie is brilliant, but the story...well...I read it in middle school."
"Honestly, I lost my faith in Cameron when he made Titanic. Avatar looks to put the final nail in his coffin. When I saw the preview I knew it would be a PC propaganda piece for eco-guilt and left-wing politics. I also knew there was no hope in seeing the dorky looking Alien Smurfs with their suck caveman weapons get wiped out. Now that would be a movie worth seeing! Sorry but I cannot root against the human race (especially with all the cool military tech), call me biased.The whole idea of some primitive alien race using nonsensical fantasty inspired creatures that look like pet dragons to defeat a high-tech army is the pinnacle of stupidity. It is like some teenage boy lacking testosterone came up with the plot. Lets see, lets combine fern gully and the smurfs for the good guys and lets make the bad guys ""greedy"" corporate humans hell bent on ""destroying the planet"" in their unsustainable need for energy to fuel their capitalist consumerism. The only thing that can save the planet is the primitive zen/native American/tribal beliefs in eco-harmony. Spare me the lecture on your economic illiteracy Cameron.The crappy video game for this should be hilarious, especially with all the kids confused why they cannot play with the cool robo-mechs with machine guns and instead get to be ""Dorky Smurf"", decked out in loin cloth armor, armed with a biodegreadable bow and arrow! Controls will include a button for ""tree planting"", ""eco-meditation"", ""recycling your weapons"" and ""low carbon footprint"" (you walk lightly and hardly breathe).What a waste of CGI. Apparently Cameron spent millions getting Smurfette's breasts ""right"". How hard is it to get them right? Just make them big! Maybe next time he can spend as much time on a real plot where you can actually root for the human race? Nah, pushing left-wing propaganda is more important than entertainment. Right Cameron? Sadly this movie will appeal to eco-pacifists who have been brainwashed that we are destroying the planet and the human race is evil.Maybe because I am human I have a problem with being considered evil but hey that is just me."
"If I could have given it a half star, then I would have. You can't even look at the pretty women in this stupid movie because they all have tails. And I'm not talking about those pretty kinds of tails! This is the Matrix but its not all black with black sunglasses. No, instead, its all blue. Getting on with the meat of the review, the symbolism of this movie is all mixed up with the typical good guys (evil white men from Europe) victimizing the tall blue bad guys (I'm guessing they represent the poor noble Native Americans here). Ultimately, all the people sit around looking dumb at the end of the movie just like they do at the end of all those Star War movies and in the Matrix series. Yawn!! I bet the Native Americans were bored as hell until the evil white man got here. Typical. You know, I'd swear the writer of this movie was smoking crack, but I don't want any crack addicts filing a law suit against me. He should just stick to directing. Do another Titanic Movie! Return of the Titanic!"
"I enjoyed this film like I enjoy watching movies like The Patriot, or Independence Day. I wasn't expecting a complex plot or detailed character development, and that's what I got. I do not think this movie belongs in the top films of this decade, and certainly not the top films of all time.The plot was unoriginal. I can think of at least three movies off the top of my head that follow the same basic story; Pocahontas, Fern Gully, and The New World. Two of them are animated films for children. I knew from watching the trailers that the marine would fall in love with the culture and eventually have to fight against the humans to save them. The fact that they win is so predictable. A quarter of the way through the film, I knew that he was going to find a way to permanently live in the avatar body.The characters were extremely shallow. Every character fell into an ancient archetype; the child, the mentor, the hero, the devil, and the list goes on and on. The protagonist is Jake Sully, but really how many people can relate to his situation; his brother is dead, an ex-marine(with traumatizing battle experience), and no use of his legs. It's not until late in the movie that the viewer could make a connection with him (feeling empathetic towards being misunderstood).One of the film's redeeming qualities is it's stunning visual effects. The world is so real and so complex. The creatures, plants, and landscapes are breath taking. The Na'vi are wonderfully generated and the battle scenes are what Cameron does best.You must enjoy this film for what it is. It is not high art. It is not a puzzling or complex film embedded with deep meaning. It does not make you think. It is entertainment. Don't think you are going to get this beautifully crafted story or complex character study. You are going to be entertained and to escape. This film does not belong in the top 250. 5/10"
"I have just seen the 3D version of Avatar. And i have to say that it is probably the best movie that i have ever seen.It can clearly be seen that the director has done his best effort to let this movie leave an imprint on your mind. There is just so much emotion going on in the movie. The story might not be the most original but it is told so beautifully that it just grips on to you.The entire movie just makes you fall in love with characters and their way of living. The beauty of the environment and the emotion put into it is just indescribable. Even though it was a 3 hour ride, the movie ends sooner than you expect and you want it to last even longer. All i can say this is a must see movie for anyone!"
"Avatar sets a new standard of movie watching. It's said before and i agree. Avatar is beautiful, new, fresh, amazing. The 3D is so natural, we are on Pandora with Jake. The story did we see before, boy meets girl. Its like Matrix, its like Dances with Wolves. Weve seen this kind of story's a hundred times. But it doestn mather. Its not that important. But every scene breaths love for cinema. The 12 year of waiting for a new Cameron was worth every day. And now we wait for more amazing movies. But first we have to see Avatar. And see it again, and again. This movie should be seen by everybody who loves cinema. AMAZING!"
"In the future, a wheelchair bound marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) reveals how his brother, who was a scientist, was killed. It is because of this death and the fact that they share the same DNA that Jake is asked by his military employers to operate his brother's avatar, a virtual body that is controlled by a person's mind. Jake is sent by a group of scientists, including the reluctant Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), to investigate the island of Pandora, which holds valuable minerals that need to be researched. Yet in regaining the use of his legs through the alien-like body of the avatar, Jake is careless and becomes separated from the rest of the science team. Stranded, he is rescued from wild monsters by a native girl, Neytiri (voiced by Zoe Saldana), who resembles the same avatar employed by Jake and the scientists. Hesitantly, she introduces Jake's avatar to the rest of her tribe. They are initially hostile to Jake's avatar but he convinces them not to kill him, and he comes to understand their customs more thoroughly.Director James Cameron has always been a filmmaker interested in spectacle. His most famous feature film Titanic, was made over a decade ago and was praised more for its technical accomplishments, rather than its scripting accomplishments. Avatar, which has accumulated significant levels of hype over its lengthy production, because of its apparent specialisation in 3D technology, is likely to follow suit. As with Titanic, this is a visually magnificent production, with a budget soaring into hundreds of millions. The 3D visuals as a whole are outstanding. The rich variety of locations, from cliff faces to thick green forests, mountain ranges and military bases, are lavishly beautiful and command to be seen on the silver screen. The lighting, in particular a forest lit with neon lights, is simply beautiful, as too is the smooth animation of the avatars themselves. Cameron's strength as a director has always lain with visuals effects and the technology. It is a quality he demonstrates most thoroughly with this film. However, despite the spectacle, some might be disappointed with the 3D technology itself. Unlike other pictures such as A Christmas Carol, Avatar opts for more subtle refinements to the visuals, like occasional glimpses of added depth to the picture, rather than launching objects and gesture towards the audience. Avatar is slightly more immediate and sharper than a standard 2D picture, but its 3D technology might not be quite as obvious and satisfying as some might have been expecting.For all of its aesthetic qualities, Avatar is highly marred by a script that is highly formulaic, recycled and severely lacking in intellect or depth. This is yet another big budget action film with a narrative devoid of interesting or sympathetic characters. Sam Worthington has a fairly unremarkable and unchallenging role as Jake, who simply doesn't have enough to do in the film. He is completely outdone by the avatar that he voices, who features in all the action scenes. Michelle Rodriguez has again found herself cast as the typical hardened girl, while Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang both have painfully obvious roles as the films typical baddies. At least Zoe Saldana has some emotion in voicing Neytiri but these are not so much fully fleshed out characters as caricatures and archetypes that only develop in the most formulaic way. The film's dialogue, written by Cameron, ranges from merely serviceable to outright poor and no matter how much the sweeping music score would like to arouse emotion in the audience, it is difficult to care about these characters. More frustrating is how rapidly the film becomes predictable because of the number of elements recycled from other films. Once Jake is taken in by the natives it is highly obvious as to what will happen and who he will rally against. Slow motion jumps for cover, exploding spaceships, last second death requests and a forbidden romance, are just some of the clichés that are used throughout a very insubstantial script. Any ethics or moral ambiguities that could have been derived from the obvious allusions to Native Americans and Colonialism are diminished because of the cartoon division between purely good and simply evil. Given that it has been over a decade since Cameron's last big budget feature film, a lot more was expected from the narrative and the array of talent here deserved far better.In spite of its failings, Avatar will attract and impress computer game enthusiasts who will see the film purely for its outstanding visuals and the action which unravels on the grandest scale. For those that are expecting something far more intelligent and substantial, this will seem like a formulaic and predictable action movie, given the various problems with the script, the over length and the largely wasted cast. The 3D visuals and cinematic quality alone are not enough to justify the hefty price of admission expected by cinemas these days."
"This movie has created so much misunderstanding for the Avatar (the real avatar) fandom. Whenever I want to talk about avatar, I have to specify everytime that I'm talking about avatar the last airbender, not the lame blue people. Stupid movie producers."
"I watched this movie yesterday, 5 years after its release. God I hated it!!! I hated it so much it ruined my morning and had to register here to lash my anger out. God this film is bad! AAAAARGHOK, let's be honest: graphics are fine, but no better than any good modern video game. That's it. Period. All the rest is lame, lame, lame.Let's proceed to the details:1. The Story. There is no story, nothing, period. No story. The plot is the lamest ever. You know how it will end after 5 minutes. You can actually guess it in the finest details. It is Pocahontas in space (with a bit of Matrix). The plot is full of contradictions and absurdities. You never get to understand how this Avatar technology works and the relation between the avatars and the humans (does the controller die if the avatar dies?, etc.). So you got this marine vet launched into this multimillion dollars project without any prior knowledge of the planets' fauna, doing stupid things and taking big risks, how is it even believable??? How can he get lost so stupidly? Didn't they manage to get a proper GPS technology? And why on earth does he risk his life by wandering in this stupid dangerous environment the whole day, while he can just close his eyes and wake up in his safe human environment.... The the humans lose this battle (unbelievably), and after years of presence and trillions of dollars of investment, they just somehow agree to let the project down and quietly return to their planet? How is it even credible? Aren't they going to come back and nuke everything for this supposedly precious metal that could save their energy problems back on Earth??? COME ON!!!2. The characters. Flat, flat, flat. Bad marine colonel is bad marine colonel. Greedy corporate capitalist is greedy corporate capitalist. Nice scientist is nice scientist. Good natives are good natives. Hero is hero, etc.3. The environment. Absurd. This planet is absurd. Absolutely no imagination involved. It's just a remake of the Earth with big dinosaurs and blue humans. The Navis.. Oh my God the Navis... You must be kidding me, Cameron! These must be the stupidest sci-fi characters I have ever seen. Even the Ewoks are more credible. Blue humanoids with tits (yes, with tits!!!!), big eyes, human voices (!!!) and African/Amerindian/tribal folklore. That's all. Period. Summary: I hate this film. You know what? I even cheered for the marines. I wanted them to nuke the hell out of these stupid Navi treehuggers.I actually hate this film so much I want to initiate public manifestations of outrage, like burning effigies of Navis in front of the UN main building."
"The first thing I ever heard about Avatar was it was amazing, a must see, the greatest movie ever made. Well, the first thing I heard was wrong. The movie had loads of entrancing visuals with fine acting, generic characters, a lacking script and an already old, recycled, generic and plain unoriginal storyline.The first thing I mentioned was the visuals, which were as stunning as you've heard. The gigantic budget for this surely must have added something to this awesome spectacle. After watching the movie I felt like the only redeeming quality was the visuals which is why I gave the movie a 4.Second, the acting. The acting was passable. Just like the acting in Transformers, I wouldn't go into this movie expecting Oscar-caliber acting. Sigourney Weaver was the high point considering most of the acting was by the CGI it just wasn't impressive. When all your acting is done by animators it's hard not to notice the lack of acting the movie has.Third, generic characters. Most James Cameron movies have characters that are interesting and more than one dimensional these are a bit of a let-down. You have complete cardboard cut-out type characters that don't seem to have any layers besides good-guy and bad-guy. No character is a wild card like Han Solo or Hannibal Lecter. These characters were not simply a one or two word definition these characters were complex and had conflicts and such. But not so with the characters in here.Fourth, a lacking script. Cheap dialogue. While dialogue isn't everything it certainly is nice to have great dialogue such as Dr. Strangelove. The dialogue is a bit generic and unoriginal.The blow that kills the movie more than any of its wounds. The awful storyline. While not only ripping off every movie pro-environment it doesn't change anything. It should be title Dances with Wolves 2: Blue Space Indians. The Näví are just blue Native Americans with less clothing. Starting with the white guy who is coming to a new place and is shown the ropes. He gets accepted into the tribe of whatever and realizes the other white people are bad people and he must help the tribe because white people don't listen to anybody but themselves. White people=bad except for the random white guy in the crowd who helped them out. Also, the one girl who is a little sketchy of the white guy at first ends up falling in love with him stupid clichè. The end is some stupid battle where white people with technology get killed by the tribe using bows and arrows and rocks. Yep, that's totally original it doesn't sound like any other movie I've ever seen (sarcasm). Dances with Wolves was a far better movie than this pro-environmental trash. In recap, this movie is completely bland tasting but has a delicious feast for the eyes. Good special effects don't make a movie. Look at Transformers 1, 2 or 3.An intriguing plot, good characters and good acting make a great movie. For stunning visuals and these other qualities I'd suggest Life of Pi, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Pacific Rim (acting was again passable in Pacific Rim's case). Avatar was a complete let down and completely unoriginal."
"I was so looking forward to watching Avatar, but about 30 minutes into the movie I became completely disappointed. My beef is with James Cameron's screenplay. It is basic and dull, as if written by a grade school student. I found the same problem with Titanic, but Avatar is worse and for me, and it ruined the movie watching experience. This simple writing, paired with the Native American retold story leaves the special effects and filming the only reasons to watch the movie.I am not alone, as I watched this movie with others who shared my sentiments. However, some others love this movie for its originality and beauty. Go figure."
"I'm one of the biggest film fanatics you'll ever meet. I've seen nearly everything made. This flick let me down. I was more disappointed in this than anything before. I heard everyone saying that this was the greatest film ever made. I believed them. But it came as a shock to me when I noticed that I'd seen before; only it was called 'The Last Samurai,' 'On Deadly Ground,' 'Pocahontas,' and several other things. The acting was good, not amazing. The action wasn't bad, but not good. The effects were great, but there were better ones a few years before. There were no elements of originality. Thus, it was a big bore. Cameron's Titanic and Terminator were a billion times better than this. However, on the upside, I thought that the 3 Oscars it won were relevant. But the 8.3 and grossing is much too exaggerated. Overall, it's one of the most overrated films ever.2.5/4"
"Avatar was only a success because of the 3D enhancement otherwise watching this film in 2D would be like having a hook attached to your eyelid at one end and strapped to a whack off rocket set for take off. Essentially what i am saying is that it is pretty darn painful to watch without the 3D. In this film a large tree is destroyed, so i say report it to Greenpeace for crimes against tree-kind. Also this destroys the views of Velvet tissue company as i don't see the humans come back 20 minutes later and plant three more trees, plus if they did this the film would be worse anyway(if it can be worse) This was a big step down for James Cameron after epics like The Terminator 1 and 2. So James if you are reading please save us the discomfort and don't make another 1 This film reminds me of Digimon and Pokemon as smurfs evolve into stupid little Na'vis So guys the only reason you should watch this film is if you are silly.Thanks for reading my rant PEACE"
"yet another Hollywood CGI moneymaker. How could this garbage cost 200million dollars? there are no actor's, and i think the writers are retarded, seriously they are mining a rare metal called Unobtainium, that's what they come opp with! the storyline is simplistic and extremely boring. some hippi BS about evil companies raping the land. And the visual effect are extremely fake, it basically looks like they are cartoon aliens. Getting extremely feed up with the CGI crap i general. This must be the most over-hyped movie ever made. a piece of polished,clean CGI crap. In 5 years nobody will even remember it existed. Masterpiece my ass."
This movie was quite hyped up because of the 3D and wonderful CGI. It really does live up to those expectations. However that could not really safe the movie's poor plot. It's hard to be original with so many stories floating around. Every story/movie takes idea from some other story. However Avatar does it pretty blatantly almost making it look like Pocahontas or Dances with Wolves but with an alien theme. I also thought the movie dragged on way too long and found myself pretty bored after 2 hours so I had to watch it in 2 days. Action and CGI fans will probably love it. If you like a good story or fantasy I suggest to stay away from this. The problem also lies within the title. It could make people believe it was based on the animated series with the same name but it's something totally different. I think I'm generous giving it a 3.
"People say that this movie is unoriginal. I disagree. I have never seen a movie where a man betrays mankind to help a bunch of Smurfs preventing mankind from surviving. One of the stupidest idea I've ever heard.This movie was a little bit better than I was expecting, but overall just wasn't that good at all. The graphics, while people may say were very good, weren't quite the best I've ever seen. The plot wasn't that interesting, nor was it very realistic. In my mind, this movie is kind of an action aspiring to be a chick-flick, the worst kind of movie there is. I also find it kind of stupid how the movie was written around a man betraying other men to help a civilization keeping man from surviving. I think that the beginning could have been a little bit longer: I would have liked to have seen Earth in the movie. I think that the end could have been shortened down to one battle instead of two. Overall, this movie really could have been done much better."
"Not blessed with two good eyes I can't see in 3D. I suspect that many of the glowing reviews this movie is generating would be more subdued if the 3D candy was missing. Sure, it still looked great in 2D but the weaknesses of the story were more revealing. The basic plot has been done before and done better(Dances with Wolves). The bad guy was completely one-dimensional. For me, a James Cameron fan, this was his least satisfying effort since The Abyss. It felt like I was watching something he scripted shortly after making Piranha 2. Dialogue has never been one of Cameron's strong points and he isn't going to generate an Oscar nomination for screenplay with lines like ""It's not over as long as I'm still breathing!"""
"After seeing this movie for the first time (4:10pm) I felt like I had just logged out from the best video game (FPSMMORPG to be specific) I'd ever played in my life and that I was going through withdrawals by not having the 3-D film in front of me for my viewing pleasure. This led me back to the theater once again with another $15 in hand to see the 10:35 showing. In 3-D they managed to do a ridiculously amazing job at making you feel like you're actually IN every scene rather than just having things fly in front of you like back in the Captain EO days at Disneyland. I hope this new, or at least new to me,'first person' 3-D animation style brings a whole new style of filming/film-making. Along with the latest CG the artist did made me feel as if this was the first movie that flawlessly combined computer animation with real life actors without it making it look cheesy or cartoony like in the Matrix 2/3, Star Wars, or even LOTR at times. From the plot, to the animation, to the love story and action packed adventure, to the acting, to the jokes, to the casting, I loved every bit of it. 10/10 from me."
"A very well rounded movie, great characters. Good beginning, good middle, great ending also. This movie appeals to the Visual with sparkles, crystal twirlies and colorful creatures, also to the Kinesthetics with feel good relationships. All throughout he movie characters are building friendships, trust and bonding. The sounds are very creative from the animal sounds to the ratatatat of the weapons in some of the fight scenes. Avatar is a little violent at times but for the most part it is beautifully made and believable. I never really like cgi before but the creators of the movie really spent a lot of time making believable figures and wonderfully overactive forest life, creatures and energetic dragonlike creatures. This movie is well worth watching."
I saw the movie and was instantly captivated by it. I am tempted to go back and see it again. I just wish that there was a book series or a movie novel like what was done with transformers but better and more like the movie. I would recommend this movie as a must see. The movie has a great plot and the acting is some of the best I have seen. The cast was well chosen. The graphics and animation are the best I have seen in years and were perfect. All in all this movie rates in a category all its own of movies that I like. James Cameron is a master when it comes to making movies and Avatar is his best piece of work to date and I commend him on this fine cinemographic piece.
"A lot of people said that this movies story isn't original and that it is predictable, but I would like to ask them: What story today is? James Cameron did not envision this movie to be some boring, over the top drama, he envisioned it to be a beautiful, inspiring, playful epic adventure, a movie without pathos, a movie with warm, honest, and idealistic characters that believe in a better world. I think that what he intended to do with this movie is to make a compendium of his earlier work, and to give homage to other movies such as The Mission, Star Wars, Jurassic park, and to even some video games like Albion, and I wouldn't call this plagiarism, because these motives are merely borrowed and blended very successfully together to make a very convincing mesh. This movie also tells a subtle ( but sometimes not so subtle :) ) story about people, their dreams and aspirations. This is one of the rare movies I will go to see in a movie theater more than once and I give it an easy 10/10! Way to go Mr Cameron!!!"
"This movie is nothing more than a self-hating white guy's masochistic jerkfest. The basic message is the usual politically correct line of ""white men bad, everyone else good"". As in such movies, the token white guy must turn his back on his own people and culture in order to ""redeem"" himself. Absolutely nothing is said about WHY humans (ie, white humans) want/need this ""unobtainium"" (puh-leeze) stuff - the reason doesn't matter. And of course, the Na'vi have no flaws - they could never be rude, or nasty or even greedy.If the racist stereotypes had been reversed, this movie would have been banned outright. Even the flashy CGI can't mask over the blatant white- bashing of this movie. No stars."
"Visually amazing. Spectacular. Awesome. Fantastic. By far one of the best looking films I have seen in ages.Plot/Story/Acting/Theme - absolutely atrocious. Bloody awful.The plot is an awful mix of The Smurfs, Pocahontas and Fern Gully. It really should be called 'Smurfahontas Gully' instead of 'Avatar'. I have also heard it described as a film about 'Magical Negroes'(for brief summary or the 'Magical Negroes' argument, see BBC article 'Is blue the new black?').It was just the same with Titanic. Visually amazing and outstanding at the time but the plot and character lacked substantially and were often cringe-worthy.I would recommend seeing it for the visual effects but little else."
"I've seen this movie twice now; both times in 3D.The visuals are spectacular without a doubt. James Cameron has always been on the leading edge of breaking new ground in special effects. You are really immersed in the world of Pandora.The plot though leaves something to be desired. Basically, you have the hero with a tragic past who goes on a mission for the bad guys. He meets up with the locals and realizes that he was working for the bad guys and changes sides and all the clichéd characters are there from the evil gung-ho Marine colonel to the jealous but noble native warrior.If you've seen Dances with Wolves or Last Samurai, or The Mission or any of a dozen of movies with a plot line like that, then you've seen this and you know exactly what is going to happen.Then we come to the plot holes.1. It took the ship 5 years to get to Pandora. Sully's brother had trained for 3 years prior to this for the ""mission."" So they had a mission almost 10 years in the making? The situation on the ground in Pandora wouldn't have changed in that 10 years? Really? I mean it looked like the operation on Pandora was relatively new...I'm pretty sure the evil corporation would have gone ahead and knocked down the tree long before Sully got to the planet. 8 years is a long time.2. Unobtainium....really? That was the best James Cameron could come up with? So it's a rare material but what does it do? Surely, Cameron could have come up with something better than that.3. If arrows couldn't penetrate the cockpit windshields in the scene where they destroy the hometree, then how could they do so in the final battle? 4. Speaking of the military equipment...wow, pretty flimsy. The heavy machineguns are obviously just M-60's with a few pieces of metal (or rubber) slapped on the sides. But the transports were pretty vulnerable to...just about everything. In 150 years, that's the best we've come up with? The mech-warrior things were cool but again...pretty vulnerable. I have to wonder if this was the part of the movie that James Cameron came up with 15 years ago and just didn't notice that the trend is unmanned.5. If the vortex cause all sorts of complications with the instruments in the transports...why were communications unaffected and why wasn't the Avatar program disrupted in there as well? 6. So the master plan to defeat the Navi was to fly a slow-moving transport aircraft as a makeshift bomber to bomb the tree? They couldn't bomb the place from orbit? And before someone jumps on me for the gravitational flux or whatever...no. They were able to get orbital imagery so they could have easily just fired some cruise missiles or whatever the future evil corporation has and carpet bombed that whole region. The first rule of combat is to kill your enemy from as far away as possible and a former (or current) Marine Recon Lt Col would know that.8. As for the end battle...what was the ground assault for? The main effort was to bomb the tree into oblivion, right? So...why send in your ground troops who were already outnumbered? Why not just send in your fast attack ships to just fire incendiary rockets at the tree and call it a day? 7. The Avatar Navi bodies were genetically engineered to reach full maturity in a short amount of time...you gotta think that such engineering would also cause a short lifespan for such a creature. After all, Sully and his brother before him were supposed to be on a 6 year mission so why create something to last longer? Not a big point but it'd be interesting to see in Avatar 2 that Jake Sully's avatar begins a rapid decline in health, haha.8. So the evil corporation just left before they got punched in the nose? Yeah, they wouldn't just come back with more firepower or anything and just blast like a 1,000 square kilometer area into smoldering ruin from where they would build a new base.I suppose the message Cameron is sending is ""hey, don't pay attention to the flimsy plot line, look how beautiful this world is that I created!"" The other messages were just lame. Hey James Cameron, Bush isn't in office any more and hopefully you weren't saying that Saddam Hussein was like the Navi...because yeah, you can bet that Hussein would have been 10 times as worse as the evil mercenaries were.And the irony of this film which cost upwards of 400 million to make and took the cutting edge of technology and probably had quite a carbon footprint...yet technology is evil and we should all go back to nature where there will be complete harmony......yeah....."
"Okay, okay, I'm fully prepared for the fact that most people will completely disagree with me on this review, but here goes...Firstly the good stuff. In 3D, Avatar is admittedly visually stunning. The world of Pandora is eye catching, filled with bio-luminescent colour most especially in its night scenes. Films such as Outlander have utilised such creatures (And even included brief glimpses of such worlds) but not on this scale. This was all heavily influenced by Cameron's obsession with under-sea exploration, from which he wanted to bring the bio-luminescent life to the surface of an alien world.Perhaps the biggest problem with Pandora is how un-alien their world is, except for this bio-luminescent theme. Everything is all too familiar. Dog-like creatures look like dogs and sound like dogs. Swinging monkey beasts look like, well, monkeys. Horse-like creatures look just like horses (And sound like Velociraptors from Jurassic Park, so-much-so that one must ask if they even changed the sound-effect). The flying beasts are very pterodactyl-like, though perhaps manage to be the most 'alien' creatures of this world, whilst the 'Thanator' (Supposedly the most ferocious ground-based creature, and the one that Cameron chose to design himself) looks more than a little reminiscent of Cameron's own design for the alien queen in Aliens (The head, certainly). Meanwhile, the Thanator suffers the same problem as the 'horse', utilising Jurassic Park T-Rex sounds, seemingly almost unchanged. The plant life on Pandora is also all-too-familiar when shown in the daytime views, with one or two interesting exceptions. Cameron has been praised for creating an entire world on screen, but I hesitate to say that everything from The Dark Crystal to George Lucas' Star Wars movies have created complete alien worlds with more originality.There are a mish-mash of unsubtle references in Avatar. The Na'vi pander to every 'native' stereotype you can think of, but primarily Native American and African. Even to the point that they refer to themselves as 'The People' rather than 'The First People' as native Americans now do. The tribal leader is performed by Wes Studi, a native American actor, probably best known for his role as Magua in Last of The Mohicans. Meanwhile, having 'schools' in which the human 'Avatars' try to teach the natives our ways, directly parallels our human past with various populations across the globe, from Africa to America. There are numerous examples of such parallels. The accented English used by some of the Na'vi even sounds like what we would consider an insulting cliché when used in old westerns, or B&W Tarzan movies.Cameron has also crammed in every politically correct reference he can, including the unsubtle use of having his villainous humans. They come out with statements such as ""We will use Shock and Awe"" or ""Fight terror with terror"".Perhaps Avatar's biggest problem is its lack of characterisation. None of the actors fare well in this respect, with possibly only Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Ghostbusters, Galaxy Quest, Snow White: A Tale of Terror) retaining some connection, when in human form. Considering their screen time, the lead characters of Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington (Terminator: Salvation) and Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana (Star Trek, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl), are shockingly forgettable and unremarkable. Even the villains are the worst form of cardboard cut-outs. Giovani Ribisi (Sky Captain, Saving Private Ryan) plays the soulless corporate evil, while the Mercenary Commander played by Stephen Lang (A regular 'guest star' actor in numerous TV series) hams it up no-end, coming out with some of the worst dialogue, which is admittedly not his fault. I'm not even sure some of the characters made it to TWO dimensions. There are no shades of grey in Avatar. The villains are unreasoningly evil without good reason, while the eco- friendly Na'vi appear to be perfect in every way, at one with nature, their world, the animals, the plants... They all even seem to be physically perfect, with nary a short or slightly overweight Na'vi in sight (Perhaps off-screen their species indulge in their own form of eugenics?) Make no mistake, Cameron is having a good old bash at the now-extinct Bush administration, right through to good ol' Vietnam. As well as trying to tell us all to give up the evils of technology and go be one with Gaia (Sorry, Aywa, the Na'vi equivalent) by hugging a tree. Never mind that he has spent absurd sums of money and used the latest cutting edge technology to create this film. In fact, the whole movie feels as though Cameron is so in love with showing off what the technology can do, that he almost completely forgot about the non-visual aspects of the film altogether.Avatar is an enjoyable enough experience for one viewing, but it has to be seen in 3D on the big screen. If you see it any other way, I think you'll miss out on everything positive about the film. In all honesty, I can't think of any other reasons to recommend Avatar, other than the 3D and the special effects. There certainly aren't any characters or story that make me want to re-visit this alien world."
"I would give it 10 just to pi$$ off all those who gave it very low rating, as everybody who did so has simply no imagination.But this movie deserves every credit it can get. It is above all is to envision where the future cinema takes us. And that future invites us to live the movies in a way unseen before.I'm looking forward to more movies like this, and of course to continuation of the Avatar trilogy.Sincerest thanks to James Cameron for sharing his dreams with us.P.S. Where seeds of all spirits, root on thy tree of souls, may they lighten my path"
"James Cameron is back and he really shows, that he did not loose his ""Mojo"". Avatar is just mind blowing and the visuals are absolutely stunning. The story might not be new, but with mankind robbing and destroying the earth, unable to listen to the sound of nature, it is more actual than ever. With Pandora, Cameron created a unique new fantasy world, worth every minute watching. The CGI sets new standards in movie making and animates a breathtaking environment, magical, spiritual, threatened by the human race in its excessive and disrespectful greed for money and economic growth. Sounds familiar? Hello rain forest. Anyway: entertaining, beautiful, sad, funny, dramatic, thrilling, romantic, spiritual,....: Hollywood at its best. Cameron is the man. Thank you for Avatar! Hope it does not only entertain but will also make people think. Cause we got our own ""Pandora"" here if we don't destroy it... The 3-D added a touch of magic that Im going to miss later on BluRay... Just awesome..."
"A movie is only as good as it's story. That being said, the story for Avatar is primarily a 'going native' movie such as Dances with the Wolves and Pocahontas, and more recently, Battle for Terra, Planet 51 and many others. The story provides nothing new or refreshing and I'd rate the movie 1/10 in terms of story for plagiarism and unoriginality.The plot. Without deviating from any traditional 'going native' theme, Avatar showcased a lack of interest on the director's part in terms of plot. Completely predictable as there were no surprises, no twists, no turns, nothing different whatsoever giving it a rating of 1/10 in terms of plot.Characters. The characters drawn up in Avatar primarily follow stereotypes. The gun nut army guy who wants to destroy everything in his path. The scientist who is not just passionate about his or her work, but willing to die for it. The hero white guy (notice he's always white) who happens to be loved by just about everyone except for the 'bad guys' and is so awesome a person that even some of those that hate him have grown to love him. A love interest for the hero, but it can't be a 'simple' love. Needs to be complex and take up a good 20 minutes in terms of plot line and relationship building. The techie geek who uses gadgets to play an active role in the events that unfold, thus satisfying that audience demographic. Of course, the corporate head honcho who puts returns ahead of everyone, including life itself and is therefore 'evil, just like all those big bad corporates out there'. There are so many more stereotypes in the movie itself, you're not surprised when anything eventful happens to them. Because there's nothing special about them and on top of that they act poorly, more time is spent showcasing the environment rather than building their characters, you find yourself devoid of much of an emotional connection with them and whether they live or die bears little consequence to you.I somewhat covered acting above, however it does not matter who you've got acting in the movie. In this one, there were primarily B-grade actors with a couple headliners such as Sigourney Weaver and actually that's about it. She herself acted abysmally and it was almost a joy just to be rid of her character.Script. This movie has one of the poorest scripts I have seen in a movie over the last decade, and this includes Evil Dead 13. If you just read the script alone, you would think it's a script for a F grade movie directed by kindergarten kids with a Paddington Bear video camera. Not a movie expected to shake things around the globe. You want a good script? Check out The Godfather series, Goodfellas, Shawshank Redemption, The Departed and so many more! James Cameron here has shown us he has the script writing genius of a middle school child. 0/10 is my verdict for script. Non-negotiable.Emotionally evocative? With all of the above factors taken into consideration, it's almost impossible to emotionally identify with the various character elements in the movie. I can't say my heart was touched at all. It did make me talk and think about stuff like this, about how a movie can gross so much and be otherwise total and utter crap. I learned nothing new from this movie, I was not inspired and I was not provoked in any manner whatsoever.Was the movie educative? No. The lesson it's preaching about 'Nature' is a lesson we've heard over and over again, from other movies to 'Save the world' activists. The masses are aware, the masses already know this repetitious message and now it's just getting annoying. If we're not interested in doing something about it, we're just not interested. Sure some might, but if nothing's changing, it's clear the majority has little or no interest in doing something about the 'precarious position nature is in'.Does the movie accurately mirror society? Not at all. Not one of the characters portrayed a 'real' personality. They're all highly stereotyped according to green peace activists versions of scientists and evil corporate honchos. It lacks objectivity and therefore loses credibility.The only possible saving grave for Avatar is the fact that they used some 'new technology' the effects of which I am not all that flabbergasted by and I honestly could not figure out what was so extra-special about the 3D technology used. The names of places seemed unrealistic and the environment lacked logical planning to it (The mountains floating in the sky had waterfalls but as they're floating, they lack any access to natural ground water and therefore springs or rivers to make the waterfalls work in the first place. Not to mention the waterfalls go nowhere but into the air and then just disappear). As far as special effects and animation goes, I'd rate the movie about a 6/10 in terms of that.If you're wondering why it's done so well at the box office, it's quite simple really. Hype. A movie that spent around $250 million to make and then spent $150 million just to market it, produces enough hype to. Also thanks to the viral nature of the movie, everyone insists 'it's a must see' and since you 'must see it in 3D', you go watch it at the cinemas and you end up boosting it's box office returns.Unfortunately at the end of this review, I will say go watch it and arrive at your own judgment, and unfortunately the only way to watch this poor movie is via 3D so you'd have to help boost it's box office revenue, further adding fuel to the hype surrounding this movie.I personally wish I could get a refund for the ticket I purchased, but it's too late for that now.Cheers!"
"One or two good parts has this movie. But complete is this movie one of the bad of all time. Also James Cameron is one of the overrated Directors of all Time. I think, the 11 Oscars with Titanic was a misjudgment. The only good Movie from James is T2."
"It's really starting to upset me that people are blatantly ignoring the rich story. THE MOVIE DOESN'T JUST HAVE GOOD GRAPHICS, IT ALSO HAS A GREAT STORY AND A POSITIVE MESSAGE THAT WE SHOULD ALL LEARN FROM. The worst part is that most people are unable see past the graphics. All it requires is a tiny bit of brain power to see how amazing the rest of the movie, beyond the graphics, ACTUALLY is. Additionally, the ""top review"" written by user ""iamthegreenfairy"" is mediocre at best. The movie IS NOT pro-""ecoterrorism"", in reality it PRO-ENVIRONMENTALISM. Anyone who has taken a basic biology class (or read a basic biology textbook) will understand how factually important it is to maintain a naturally healthy and lush environment, i.e. lots of trees and plants, less pollution, more recycling, respecting *natives*, etc.,.."
"I just can't believe Avatar is a ..movie. I was trying to watch the super-cool special effects I've been told about but all i could saw was a big --$--. Cheap actors, cheap everything... all the money went in things made by computers. I can't believe people actually felt in love with the avatar's world... it's just.. disgusting. Nice i tough... a reflection of how our world its stupid enough to turn heaven into hell fastly. but arrrr. they try to make a new Jesus with the principal actor.. hes not one of them but hes the hero.. the legend of their world... its an American- bible... to blind people with visual effects and a meaning-lookalike... this is bullshit... i felt the same way i feel when i watch Nazis propaganda shortcuts against jew around the 30s-40s"
"This film is way over hyped, I'm glad I didn't see it in 3d (although to be honest I don't put much stock in 3d) first time round as it may of made me one of these zombies who think it's epic.The film is nothing special, it's a story I saw many years ago when I was about 6 in a cinema when my aunt and uncle took me to see Pocahontas. In fact if I were you and you have the ability to choose between the two, I'd suggest you choose Pocahontas as it's not but numbingly as long and you will probably enjoy it more! And don't worry as the plots are almost near identical you'll still be able to talk about the film with your friends."
"It takes all sorts to make a world. Some say that Cameron is a consummate writer and director. Others tell the truth. But seriously, what happens when a ten-year old child is given millions of dollars to make a movie? We get Avatar. A film so immature, condescending and so filled with plagiarism's that even though a friend lent me the DVD, so I watched it for free, I still felt robbed. Of my time. I was simply hoping that it would get better. But it did not. And what was with the music? There were so many bars of Titanic in there, I wondered if it was the same composer. Oh waitit was. And what's with the sympathy for the Na'vi? Or any indigenous people? I've no sympathy for people who use other animals to get about on or fly. Almost every so-called civilisation in the past, had slaves, practised unbelievable cruelty and preyed on the weak and those with less intelligence. The native peoples who were dominated by stronger force, as happened in America (or name your own) were no better than those who dominated them. There's no lessons that can be learnt from this waste of money and talent."
"It's hard not to like James Cameron, after all he's a director who exploded onto the cinema scene in the 1980s when he directed the Terminator, on a cheap budget of 7 million dollars and made it one hell of a ride. Since then he's gone onto direct blockbusters such as Aliens, the Abyss, Terminator 2 and the record breaking Titanic. Each one of these films landmarks in the development of CGI. This is because Cameron is the kind of director who follows the rule that CGI should be used as a tool to support the story, not as a gimmick like so many other blockbuster films.After Titanic was released in 1997, Cameron dropped out of the public eye to begin developing the technology for his new film Avatar. Cameron made it clear that he wanted to make the nearly 90% of the film CGI with motion capture performances in CGI environments. Last but not least, he wanted the film to be filmed in 3D Stereoscopic film. The hype was flying. Could it really be? The king of special effects (and the world) was now touching a struggling technology? Would Avatar be the landmark film for 3D? So after 12 years of work, Avatar is finally here and the question is, is it any good? Not really.Avatar tells the story of Jack Sully, a paralyzed marine who is hired by a corporation working on the planet Pandora to participate in the Avatar program. The Avatar program is designed to help humans survive Pandora's environment and communicate with the locals of a tribe called the Na'vi. The program works by hooking the human mind up to an artificially grown Na'vi body created from the humans DNA, allowing the Na'vi to spring to life while its human counterpart sleeps in a chamber. Jake's brother participated in the program until he was killed and Jake is the only person with matching DNA.Naturally Jake accepts this as an opportunity to regain his ability to walk. He is given instructions by his superiors who are using the planet to mine for ""unobtainium"" to report them any information on where they might find it. He must also inform the Na'vi of upcoming mining operations.*SPOILERS* Soon enough, Jake begins to meet and mingle with the locals who deride the humans for destroying much of their land and its spirits. Though Jake is initially met with hostility by the locals, he soon achieves acceptance and begins to appreciate Na'vi culture. Ultimately he is forced to making the Hollywood decision of choosing between the humans side or the Na'vi's, ultimately leading to an epic battle of nature vs man made.If you think the plot sounds very familiar, its because you've either seen Pocahontas or Dances With Wolves. Both films were about Americans who are sent to deal with indigenous people who end up accepting him before he ultimately has to face the choice of betraying his culture or the indigenous tribes. Avatar basically just retells those stories with CGI and a different setting. But where as those films were brave enough to directly address the conflict between Americans and Native Americans, Avatar wimps out.Even worse is the flat character development. None of the characters have any real depth and mostly stick to the bare bones archetypes like the American who appreciates adopting a new culture, the concerned Scientist who is always right but ignored by superiors, the skeptical tribe leader, the doomed love interest and the outright evil greedy humans. What exactly happened to the script in the 12 years this movie was being produced? Did Cameron even bother to at least write some character profiles? When making a film that's nearly three hours long, you need interesting characters to fill in the running time.Much has been made about the films use of 3D and CGI, and as a first time 3D goer I can say that it was an interesting experience seeing things pop out of the screen. Some reviewers here said that the 3D here wasn't noticeable. I think this was Cameron's intention as to make it seem much more natural. Even in the 2D Blur Ray version, Cameron's understanding of how to use 3D a camera transcends across to 2D screens beautifully.However for 3D to enhance the Cinema experience it needs to be used in films, that tell good stories. Film makers need to remember that when making a 3D film, you still need a great story to support the experience.While the story falters heavily, the films productions reigns supreme in every element of the art design and the language of the Na'vi. The world of Pandora does come alive, its just a shame that there isn't any interesting characters or narrative to accompany it.When I left the cinema, I really wanted to like Avatar for its special effects and production values but as I thought more about it overtime, the more I felt bothered by the overly clichéd archetypes. Its ironic to say that a 3D film like this can't manage to have characters with more than one dimension. This is a shame because for all the effort that has clearly gone into the production, there is no story here to make Avatar worthwhile.Avatar is a letdown from Cameron's previous exploits. But if Cameron uses the experience, he gained from its production, to make a film with a deep storyline and true flesh and blood characters. I'd let him reclaim his throne and become the ""King of the world"" again."
"If you like special effects, you'll love Avatar.As for the storyline, well, anyone born in the late '80s and early 90s' knows exactly what this movie is: Disney's Pocahontas --- except its not a movie geared towards kids, its on a different planet, instead of Native Americans you get aliens, and instead of gold the invaders are looking for some other kind of mineral. Other than those exceptions (and possibly some that I forgot), the similarities are way to obvious to ignore: people from Earth (the British) invade another planet (the New World) to search for some really rare and expensive mineral (gold) but to get the mineral, they have to go through the aliens (Native Americans) that live there, then one of their people (John Smith) learns their culture, falls for the chief's daughter (Pocahontas) and decides the aliens are decent people who should be left alone, then they all go to war and try to kill each other."
"Ah, the two and a half hour film that seems to have a huge following, and is often given respect for apparently being an original film and a completely artistic achievement from a director who specializes in the technical. For those of you who are expecting me to give this film a good review I suggest you leave now because that is not what is happening here. Instead of getting this artistic achievement form a talented director we are instead given a re-hash of better films like Dances With Wolves, with a healthy dose of Fern Gully and a few rip-offs from some not so very well known stories those being Call Me Joe in which a paralyzed character remote controls an alien avatar with his mind, and the Noon Universe with a story taking place on a planet called Pandora with an alien species called the Nave. Hmm this seems to be bordering on plagiarism doesn't it? But oh well no one will care. The story is your basic love the trees and hate the militaristic, colonizing and resource abusing nature of modern man fare. Complete with the disgruntled modern main character who goes in and meets members of this 'savage' species, meets a girl of this group, she shows him all the beauty of nature (something anyone on this planet wouldn't need explaining to see, seriously if this movie achieves anything it looks damn good) and of course he falls for her and joins in their cause. Yes we've seen this before, it's not a bad story but it has been done better, the last notable version of this old tale is Edward Zwick's Last Samurai, a story in which Tom Cruise (of course a disgruntled modern man) joins forces with the samurai after staying with them as a prisoner. What worked about that story was the fact that it wasn't completely pretentious like Avatar, and there were multiple messages, there was of course the love nature bit, but also it wasn't exactly shinning the concept of modernization like this or Dances with Wolves, instead it focused more on honor, respect and not letting new flashy things make you forget who you really are underneath. All of this is missing in Avatar, and the further I got into the movie the more I felt Cameron's intentions with the films message weren't so honest. It seems instead he was trying to create a Star Wars for a new generation, something he seems to have succeeded in that respect everyone is buying into it, it's extremely over-hyped mostly because it's prettier than everything else out on the market. But beyond all of that the 3-D vs.2-D experience is no different, okay so maybe an object flying towards the screen will be more noticeable, but that's about it, that's pretty much all the capabilities of 3-D, some things pop-up but it never gives the sense of immersion that say, a video game would. You still don't feel like a part of the film, now all we're doing is watching a really well animated moving pop-up book, with extremely bad dialogue 'they'll eat your eyes for jujubes' is my all time favorite shitty line of mainstream cinema history, yes other movies have worse dialogue it's just funny to see writing that horrible in a movie being taken so seriously and being praised like this one. So what did I get out of Avatar, nothing it was a pretty movie, it had high-concept that could have been good but failed, and it's anti-commercialism story could have been better had someone with writing talent actually written the script, and of course there's the overtly cheesy dialogue, and character arcs. I find nothing wrong with using archetypal characters, after all and archetypal story as old as film itself isn't the same without the archetypes, the only problem is they come off as sort of unintentional parodies of what they are, we get the overtly pulp Colonel Miles, the overtly Native American quibbles of Neytiri, and the over the top heroics and acts of daring of Jake. Another problem with films like these though is they always throw in the white guy, it's not until he comes that the Na'vi actually start kicking major military ass, and of course he's some sort of prophetic savior because you know they couldn't do it without him. That was another major success of Last Samurai; we never get the feeling that Cruise's presence really makes any deep impact in the battle against Japan's change into Western culture. We get the feeling that the Samurai would face pretty much the same fate with or without him, instead he's just there, he's no extreme bad-ass who changes the course of events for the people he's decided to join, instead he just basically becomes another statistic, an extra man on the battlefield. He may survive the story but there is no major differentiating outcome, he pleads to the emperor of Japan and heads back to the little village he spent an entire winter in, to more than likely die from the wounds he received during the films climactic battle. We never get that here; we feel that the Na'vi was instead a completely incompetent species up until Jake arrives to help them out. Yeah they're still dangerous as hell outside of all the military gear, but that point is rendered moot when any excavation into that jungle consists of a few military vehicles and some pretty impenetrable big rig machinery. As it stands, Avatar is an extremely pretty movie, void of soul or substance, and will be remembered as one of the first films to actually use 3-D well. Which is pretty much the sole reason it's so huge, as today's mainstream audiences buy into things that are pretty."
"In the future, a paraplegic marine's avatar (a goofy blue-skinned cartoon-like incarnation of himself that he controls while sleeping) is sent on a mission to mingle with the natives of a distant planet. The pictures are pretty but the story is a lame rehash of a theme that has been done much better before. The movie becomes increasingly tedious as it lumbers along for nearly three hours. Cameron is not so much interested in making a compelling movie as in flaunting his prowess with special effects. Weaver's presence only serves to remind one of how good a sci-fi film can be (""Alien""). This nonsensical movie plays out like a dull computer game."
"It would be lovely to be able enjoy a good movie from a used-to-be good director, but this is not the case. ""Avatar"" can only offer you somewhat interesting CGI, but no story, no characters and no way to relate to this overpriced cartoon in any way. On the positive side, I found Zoe Saldana as Neytiri to be kind of cute. What I specifically disliked: 1) There are ridiculous entities in ""Avatar"" that sound just stupid and come with no explanation, such as the name of this moon, which is 'Pandora'. Is it an indigenous name or a nickname? What's this 'Unobtanium' mineral and what does it do aside from just being potentially shiny? Are those unexplainable floating mountains made of 'Unobtanium'? In science, this term is used for describing a non-existing material with impossible qualities. 2) I do not even have to mention that ""Avatar"" feels like a bad mix of 'Star Wars', 'Dances with Wolves', 'Matrix', 'Pocahontas' and a half a dozen of other rather famous films and even video games. A number of concepts were so obviously recycled from ""Aliens"" that it was sickening to watch. There are no original ideas in ""Avatar"". 3) Why are those blue aliens act so much like people from African tribes? Them aliens should not have been from Africa, right? What is all this African and Middle Eastern music for? 4) What is the story with the animals? Why do they mostly look and act like the Earth animals. I can mention the Pandorian animal species that look to me so much like rhinos, horses, wolves, and even the ancient flying dinosaurs - the pterodactyls. Those natives just keep riding them extra-multi legged horses in a usual Earth-like way! Looks like the moon of Pandora was borrowing lots of animals from Earth. Whoever might have been doing this? 5) How come that the blue Pandorian aliens use all the familiar primitive Earth weapons? I am talking about bows and arrows, bolos and such. 6) What is the story with the English language? Its comprehension among the characters goes on and off all the time. First they do not speak any English, then they speak some broken English, then no one speaks English again and then, after months of studying the native language, the main character fellow all of a sudden needs an interpreter to speak to the crowd of locals. So, he seems to have forgotten the Pandorian language and the locals forgot every bit of English all of a sudden. 7) How come that the arrows that the natives shoot are harmless to the aircraft at first and then then work as effectively as armor-piercing munitions with depleted Uranium cores? 8) Why the whole movie has no background story? This makes all the characters even more flat and lifeless. Also, one can get sick of all this liberal anti-American and racist ideology that ""Avatar"" builds upon. Couldn't they play some other cards that are not so obvious and overused? Anyway, it is a great shame that this potentially tremendous movie turned out even worse than 'Terminator 2'. I do not regret watching ""Avatar"", though. Now, I know exactly what kind of mental abilities to expect from people who rave about it."
"This Movie is really really really really Awesome and it is very action packed and has an awesome storyline to it. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET YOU NEED TO IT IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES. I really enjoyed it and I hope this review is helpful to all of u that have not seen it yet. IF NOT PLEASE DO! So if you are one of the millions who loved Avatar when you saw it in theaters, or one of the people who didn't get around to seeing it, now is your time. Pick this movie up right away without hesitation. Keep an open mind, and let yourself become immersed. You do not want to miss what many people believe is one of the top movies of all time."
"(this post is an extension of my own review I posted on other film related site)Effects: Astounding technically, yes, but 3d experience was weird. I mean, first you get nice feel of new dimension, but with every second you get used to it and it doesn't make you ""wow"" later. Maybe the film was too long? Maybe number of 3d shots was too small? Or they were used badly?Story: The film was painfully predictable, probably to make all 10-year olds capable of understanding the plot (alhough ""the plot"" is a way, way too big word). From the first minutes the main ""plot"" was like ""connect 4 dots to form a square"". Not that I expect ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Primer"" type of plot, but hey... James, you spent bazillion years on that story? How about some not good/bad cliché characters? How about casting not-wood-like-one-angry-face-actor as the main protagonist? How about adding more interesting features of ""new"" animals other than that idea they get extra pair of limbs? How about explaining why those marines even cared about waiting for scout mission, they had equipment to basically eradicate whomever they wanted. And I really miss wasted opportunity to develop (only slightly touched) idea of blending a person with one's avatar. That would possibly add some depth to this story of clichés. Summing up - yeah, in terms of effects film is worth seeing, shows that CGI of the main female character plays better than main human male actor, but I expected story which is less ""fairy tale/clichés-ful"" or has characters I would care about. ""Game-changer"" James? Only if we assume that your technique will be used in the future for films like ""Hulk"" in which we will get an opportunity to add a bit of human emotions or actor's face features to animated version of himself. Otherwise the film is yet another overrated CGI bubble. Let me end with a quote I heard somewhere: ""Nice that the film is made in three dimensions, but apart from effects, the film is one dimensional""."
"Somehow James Cameron has amassed a reputation as one of the premier directors of the late 20th and early 21st century. The man's handiwork with a camera cannot be denied, but his taste in plots is among the worst. If not for an abundance of unnecessary swearing, this movie would have been rated PG (as it should have been), and would belong alongside other fairy tales such as Cinderella and Pocahontas. It's hard to see what ""Avatar"" does well, asides from beautiful special effects. There's not enough action to warrant a ""Transformers"" like buzz, and there isn't enough plot to allow for a genuine love story. How this movie has amassed so many positive reviews is beyond me. Oh wait, it was made for American movie-goers."
"Just got back from watching Avatar and I have to say I was impressed with the 3d and the digital characters. The story, on the other hand, was comically bad.The 3d didn't work for everything, but it work the best when it was used for dust and particles. It really drew you into the image. The digital characters were better visually than Gollum in the LOTR films, though the ""character"" Gollum had nothing in Avatar that was even close.Visually, probably the best I've seen. Story, characters, and dialog, among the cheesiest films I've seen. (and not good cheese, like Army of Darkness) I don't know if it was worth the $ to see in the theater, but sure as heck wouldn't bother to rent or buy the DVD."
"I have never gone to a cinema with expectations like this. They were enormous, James Cameron, the great creator of films that have leaved great tracks in the world of films. Could he do it again? Could he outshine all he'd ever done before?And there I sat, in my chair. Completely entranced by the world of Na'Vi. I lost myself in amazement, I were in there world, felt what they felt, saw what they saw. I have never felt that overwhelming feeling before.Cameron has created a world on the movie screen that I never has seen before. It is so beautiful, so sharp and so convincing that i just sat there, blown away by the moment. Thats what i call movie magic, and thats what Cameron has created.I will never forget this film. It is my greatest experience i have ever had in a cinema auditorium. One word: Wonderful."
I am just here to say that Endgame is better then Avatar
"Saw it a couple weeks ago. I had high hopes for the movie, but it was't quite what I expected. All the great reviews and user comments and what did I get.... A mediocre movie with great special effects. The movie itself was predictable and I wasn't surprised even once during the movie. This was my first 3D-experience, so the first hours or so went to adjusting to 3D- image. It tells a lot about the movie, if you are more interested about the CGI than the movie itself. .I think this movie is highly overrated. The acting was OK, but nothing superb.This is not a bad movie, but I don't consider this to be one of the best movies of all time. Not even close."
"I seem to be in a minority who believes that a film's score depends on many factors. Some of which undoubtedly get 9/10. These include the obvious like special effects and direction. However, plot and imagination score poorly, as do dialogue and cliché avoidance. It's fine to take coral reefs as inspiration for an extraterrestrial jungle but it isn't new; neither are floating rocks; illuminating the ground with each step is a tribute to Michael Jackson, I get that; alien sex, which is much like ours only taller; horses with extra legs (come on!); and dragons!? Are our human minds so limited that artists have to fall back on mythical creatures? I might be judging unfairly here. Maybe we've conceived of all we are able to conceive for marketable films. Anything else just wouldn't sell.And then there's the plot. The good guys win. I've clicked on ""contains spoilers"" just in case no one knew. Okay, so maybe the question is how. And that is another of my gripes about this movie. Strength won the day. The more woolly among us may say the forces of nature or forces of good intentions did but you only have to scratch the surface of this very superficial and moralising plot to see that winning didn't happen without it. No cleverness or ingenuity, just brute force. The irony is is that this is a sanctimonious movie with an unintentionally gloomy moral.After seeing the way the majority voted (and I include my own 6/10 vote in that) I think the abiding moral for producers might be; make a movie with lots of bright colours and flashing lights and you're onto a winner."
"I would like to start this review by saying that I'm not trying to be way out or off the wall, I wouldn't dislike a film for the sake of it and I watched this film with the best of intentions. After looking forward to this film for well in excess of a year I finally got my chance to watch it on Premiere night in the full glory of 3D. But, sadly I was extremely disappointed. Let me first state the things I liked about the movie. The graphics were awe-inspiring leaving me with my mouth gaping at the gorgeous environment of Pandora. Top performances from the leading cast and an inspiring assumption of future human technology from the ships to the Mechs.I would also like to say I love the way this film is encouraging the development of 3D cinema. Now the bad. Afetr seeing all of Cameron's previous films and without exception loving every single one, this film failed to invoke any emotion whatsoever. From the non-creative creatures that were basically earth-based animals merged together for example the love child of a hammerhead shark and a rhino to the orangutans with a couple of extra limbs and least not forget the over-sized, blue tribesman of the Amazon. The film bumbled along for what seemed like a lifetime staggering from one uninteresting scene to another like the pathetic scene in which Jake was introduced to his weird bird-dragon to the predictable conclusion of him being good enough to control the largest of the bird-dragons solely relying on it's breath-taking CGI. Not to mention that Cameron seems to have lifted the entire storyline from the 1992 kids film FernGully. Also, I felt like I was being hit over the head continuously with the message that humans are a destructive race, I'm not blind I can see the what's happening to the world around me, I just don't want it forced down my throat when I'm trying to watch a film. If this film had not been the first 3D film I'd ever seen or I was watching it at home, I can honestly say I wouldn't have seen the end. In closing, I would like to note my concern for the mentality of the IMDb user that instantly awards this film 10/10 based on nothing but the opinions of their friends and media hype. I personally have met 2 people who have never seen it and yet have given it 10/10 and thereby soiling the good name of IMDb. I would not say this is the worst film I have ever seen by any means but the hype surrounding it is unjustified. If this film had been made by an unknown director then I have no doubt that it would be in the bargain DVD bin at your nearest Blockbuster."
"It's as if not a bad word can be said about Avatar. I tried at work the other day and was promptly shouted down. ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" has nothing on this, though perhaps in reverseyou can see everything. Yes brilliant CGI effects. Outstanding! But take away all the CGI and within the first 30/40 minutes of this almost 3 hour performance it had ticked nearly every predicable Hollywood cliché. People seem to be so overwhelmed by the CGI and fail to notice just how poor and predicable the script/storyline is. Style over substance?A ridiculously familiar and predictably story of a man separated from his comrades and lost in a hazardous environment. He is saved from certain death by a pretty heroine/native who eventually warms to him. They both fall in love with one another. She then brings him home to meet mum and dad who just happen to be the leaders of her group/tribe. Needless to say she also has a brother who immediately takes a dislike to the hero, and also is threatened by his presenceThey have the predicable encounter and the hero proves himself to be worthy. And on it goes... until the all too predictable climax battle between the hero and Mr. Bad Guy. It seems to me that during the reported 10 years(?) it has taken to bring Avatar to the screen 99% of the creative powers/money must have been spent on the CGI and the script/storyline was just tacked on as an after thought. Having spent so much time and money on such a venture I would have expected a much higher calibre of story/script.The only positive thing I can find to say about Avatar is hopefully when all the media fuss about Avatar and the CGI has died down other films may be made using equally as brilliant CGI effects but with much more imaginative/original storyline/script.Finally I didn't hate the film I expected more for the $100s of millions spent just massively disappointed."
"Rainn Wilson calls it ""Dancing with Avatars"", which is accurate. It's more or less a Native American allegory. Astonishing effects and production, with a been there/done that story. No film has ever had a greater disconnect between its form (digital and violent) and content (respect the earth, its spirits, and its native people who are connected with it).On the drive home I heard a story on ""The Moth"" that had more true humanity in 15 minutes than Avatar has in its 2.5 hours. The trailer for Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" looks interesting, though."
"I have never written a movie review, I am certainly not an idolater of James Cameron, but I just saw Avatar in 3D on a tiny screen at in my local cinema and felt compelled to say how impressed I was. In the past, I have left Cameron movies feeling a bit duped (Titanic) by stunning use of technology to mask derivative stories. This was different. He takes a story derived from traditional American lore and then creates a new alien world with a fully immersed cultural experience. The best comparison I can offer is to a movie like Last of the Mohegans, which offers you the amazing experience of running with a different people, and for a couple (or 3) hours, feeling like you see the world through there eyes, with awe of their skills and appreciation for their beliefs. This is like that, except it's a world invented and created by James Cameron. For his success in using new movie technology to bring us into his imagination Cameron deserves the applause, and money... or most of it."
"I took my girl to see Avatar tonight and we both were so impressed with this movie, Avatar I would be put in the top ten movies of 2009 it was as good as Transformers 2 or Star Trek. And it will be a movie I will get as soon as it hit's DVD or I think I might even finally even get Blu-Ray. The 3D grafx were great and digital work for the characters was outstanding, if Cameron doesn't take a lot of the awards in the academy awards I think they would get so much hate mail, this was one film that I can't wait to see 2 and 3... I would also would love to see more about Pandora as well as the Na 'Vi. I would really like to see this series finding it's way in to the books like Star Wars or Star Trek"
"Everyone is saying that Avatar was the most amazing film of the year, but I disagree. This film was not even close to being the best film of the year. It was nothing special. I'm not saying that it was a horrible film because it wasn't. There were some good things about it...well only really one. Which was the CGI. If it had to win an award for that it would most likely win. When it comes to the story it was so predictable and nothing really interesting. I love science fiction movies but this one was not for me. I am a huge fan of good stories and great plots, but again it was not any good when it came to the story. You knew what was going to happen at the very beginning. You knew that Jake was going to fall in love with Neytiri and that he was going to want to stay with the people of Pandora. I don't want to bash the film but I guess I am anyway. I did not like it...just another typical love story/science fiction movie."
"Saw it while in good mood. Great movie. Review too short, they say. That ain't true. I just wanna submit. This i actually my first review. Hope people will like it. Thanks."
"It was a spectacular movie with ""AMAZING CGI"" for something made in 2009! I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in Fantasy/Mystery kind of movies. Once again 10/10 it's a must watch movie."
My Rating : 9/10Avatar is outstanding. I don't think I had seen a more visually beautiful film up until Avatar. This was back in 2009 and I had watched it in 3D and I was completely blown away by the visuals. This probably is the best 3D movie I've ever seen. Check it out. I simply don't understand how some people have given it a low rating. This is top notch movie-watching experience.
"Wow! First time seeing this, almost 10 years after it was released, and I gotta say what a fantastic film it was. 
The only downside to this movie was that it is reminiscent of white people to do what they did and destroy foreign culture.
I cannot wait for the next one."
This science fiction adventure film set in the 2150s has very good special effects - but that's its only appeal. There's little else to enjoy in this rambling and insubstantial extraterrestrial fairy tale.I can't understand why this is the world's highest-grossing film of all time.
"Cameron really knows his drama. A tear-jerking love story, the heartfelt downfall at its climax: he applies the rules of drama like few others can. That said this reeks of a routine to go for. Despite such skills deserving high praise its repetition can't be said to be the epitome of greatness. On the contrary: besides these qualities we'd like to have some substance. To make things shine is great but a lame standard shining bright is a lame standard still. Nice colours, lots of emotion and baffling CGI: it is almost to be held against a film if all it does is hiding the mediocrity of its plot and its implications (""its meaning"" that is). That said Avatar may still be the film that uses 3D technology best. That spells genuine innovation and adds to cinema as a whole. That is a method to be repeated and copied - only that this one is the original and hasn't been copied yet. That's truly commendable and a great feat. Anyway: I love philosophy, actual meaning in films and something to think about. Even the best and most innovative use of 3D can't cover all that, can it? So yeah... At this point I see a decent film but no more.There is a lot more to it though. The setting as such betrays a deep insight into the Zeitgeist, into the hidden desires of present time viewers. It is an ode to technology, to the possibility to shape one's self as well as connecting to others. At the same time the demolition of the old and the bringers of this technology are put in a harsh light. Indeed: we do not trust our own progress. We love it and fear it at the same time. We wish for unlimited possibilities, the transcendence of time, space and body, yet we also wish for stability, harmony and peace. It is impossible to fulfill the conflicting desires of our time. Or is it? Avatar manages to combine the conservative and the progressive and that is not a small feat. Living as an ""Avatar"", like me being Mario in a Video Game, is where it starts. Right into the promises of the past: actually meaningful human relations, breaking things down to the eternally important parts of life, a harmonious tradition. The clash is quite literal: the colonial high-tech army against the natives of a paradise, living in harmony with themselves and their nature.However: the Na'Vi do not just work as a safe harbour, a bastion against the flood of progress. They also bring a promise we know as new, as a part of progress in our own world. They can ""upload"" their experiences, ""download"" the past and connect to other living beings by ""jacking in"". That is exactly how they ""become one with nature"", how their ""natural"", ""traditional"" lifestyle works. They manage to unite our conflicting desires and truly appeal to something most people do not even see. It is keen insight that looks immensely deep what is required to create this specific instantiation of a superficially glossy fantasy world. It's the ""Internet Indians"", the unity of everything, that many oh-so sophisticated viewers overlook when complaining about the flatness of this eye-candy. Avatar holds a grasp on THE desire of our time. There is substance. Since ""Matrix"" it is customary to have a film claim depth. Where Matrix actually does hold depth, although not behind every Greek name and wisecrack reference, many others did not. Lots of references, likening one's film to insightful classics: people see depth where it is supposed. This one on the other hand appeals to emotions and thankfully never really pretends to be a piece of philosophy. Only that it is. It truly is a milestone. If I wouldn't detest the plastic perfection, the glossy finish and the flat plot I'd rate this even higher. Even so I can't help but acknowledge the mastery this film was done with as well as its creators' insights into the big questions of our time. Truly a great film!"
"James Cameron's 'Avatar' is 100% a masterpiece. It is by far the most impressive film ever made in the visual department. it took a lot of efforts and years of waiting to come up with such an advanced CGI effects and motion captures. to this day, 7 years after avatar was released, i haven't seen even one movie that can be compared with avatar's visually beauties. No, Avatar doesn't resemble Pocahontas in any way. It doesn't have any direct connection to other films. It is an original story, which is refreshing since most of the new movies are based upon or rebooting something else. James Cameron made the two most financially successful movies of all time - 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', and it's not a coincidence. This guy is a real genius! I recommend Avatar to ANYONE who appreciate the art of films and the fact that a movie is not perfect without it's beauties and visual factors. 10 out of 10. an unworldly masterclass!"
"I'll try and not spoil too much with this review.OS = This movie is easily among st one of the best movies I have seen, but that seemed to be the case when it comes to James Cameron movies.1= This movie is visually stunning right from the beginning not only visually stunning but also beautiful, you could also pause the movie at any point and your TV could be doubled as a over sized picture frame.2= Not only this movie allows you to understand the Avatar Universe early but it also makes it easy for you to understand the Avatar Universe.3= The plot from the movie to me feels almost like it could be a Star Trek Movie (NOT JJ ABREMS REBOOT). Of curse I'm talking about the classic Star Trek Movies.4= There is an Alien creature in the movie that kind of looks like of an Alien Xenomorph.5= The Pandora Planet also an African Jungle Amazon feel an look to it. The reason I found that interesting is because that is all I was thinking about while I was watching the movies as to the regards of the sitting in which the movie takes place.6= As I was watching the movie I feel that the over all message of the movie is Cultural Understanding, and Cultural Acceptance more Understanding than Acceptance. Which goes along with my Statement from above. About the movie feeling like an idea for a Classic Star Trek Movie.7= In addition as I was watching the movie I was constantly reminded of the metaphor of the old West in which the people in the West invade and attack the Native Americans but in space. In this case the Humans are the Western Invaders, and the Na'vi are the Native Americans.8= The VO (Voice Over) in the movie is really great, it is told in the format of a Video Diary, and I'm not just talking about Jack the main character telling us what's going in the terms of his mission, but also in the terms of his changing feelings through out the movie and what is he planing what to do. And it's not your typical Video Diary VO either, it's not just VO in the beginning to open the movie and at the same time explain to us the audience what the world of Pandora is. And another VO at the end to close the movie up and at the same time to show what the effects of climax events had on both sides. No it's not like that at all, Jack the main character constantly provides his VO in his POV so it truly becomes a Video Dairy, and not just away for us the audience to know what is going on. And I like that it gives you a sense of feeling that the audience is a character in the movie, and that the main character Jack is constantly reporting back to you the audience in Video Diary format. Like you are an government official back on earth or something. I like movies that have that, it's too bad that not more movies have that.9= Another thing I have noticed while watching the movie is that the main bases for the Na'vi Cutler, is being one with Nature. Now the Na'vi are literally one with Nature, but it got me thinking maybe humans should be with one with Nature. I'm talking MORE than JUST camping and hugging trees, no I'm talking about NOT holding innocent animals captive and NOT shooting innocent animals just for the sport of it. I think the only justly reasons to kill an animal is, A when you are protecting your self, and B when you need you need food while in nature. For me those are the ONLY two justly reasons to kill an animal(s), and the like. So in short I think we should try and take a page from the Na'vi Cutler's book and try and coexist with animals, because if we don't then I would agree with Agent Smith in the first Matrix movie when he said that Humans are nothing but a Diseases Plague a Cancer for this planet. I don't know about you but the very idea bring compered to an Infection is uneasy to me to say the least.10= Any ways back to the cherry stuff, this movie is not only beautiful visually but as for the Emotional aspect that is also beautiful.11= The Soundtrack. Not only it's the one of the best Soundtracks I have heard in any movie, but also the Soundtrack helps you care about the characters and what's going on at that point in time in the movie. But also at one point in the movie I thought the Soundtrack was so good I not only thought to myself that I got to get this Soundtrack, but also some of the music for this movie is so relaxing it puts you in a Meditative State at least it did for me. And on top of all that the Soundtrack for this movie I found that it also helps you get invested in more than just the characters in the movie but it also gets you invested in the movie as a whole, on what is happening at that point in the movie on what is about to happen, etc.CS= Now the movie is not perfect I did have some minor problems in it, such as the Climax fight. And I have to admit at some parts it's really predictable like predicting who the real villain is early on in the movie. And finally I'm not sure this movie really needs a sequel, much less multiple sequels, to me it wraps everything up nicely. The only reason to make sequel(s) to this movies is I'm sorry to say Greed"
"After hearing about this movie for almost 7 years, I've finally watched this and think its awesome. It has great visual effects, a fine cast and an amazing soundtrack. I also like this movie better then Titanic. I mean it has some sad scenes in it, but is much more powerful then Titanic. Its also sort of like the animated film Ferngully the Last Rain-forest, but with more action. It also does have an environmental message that we need to protect all the rain- forests. I think the best scene in this movie was the battle sequence between both the Earthlings and the Na'vi and the hero Jake Sully against the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. I also like the flying sequences in the movie when Jake and Neytiri were flying those bird like creatures all over Pandora. In the end after the great big battle between the humans and Na'vi, most humans were exiled from Pandora back to Earth never to return. Some however were allowed to stay cause they respected Pandora's environment. Jake also became a member of the Na'vi society and all's well that ends well. Awesome movie here and I so recommend this to other people who have not seen it. It also reminds me of Star Wars a little and I don't care what James Cameron thinks of The Force Awakens cause that's still my most favorite movie of all time."
"Lovely movie.There was an energy, there was an effort put into every moment of the movie. No scene went on too long, no plot holes fell through. It was the comic, come alive Just got back from my second viewing of Avatar in the stunning Max 3D and it was even better this time around. I won't go into the story line as you probably already have an idea of this and i don't want to add any spoilers. The storyline itself is simple but not unintelligent and keeps you gripped from start to finish. There is lots of action, battle scenes, sci fie, and a love story to keep you occupied. The special effects are amazing and the attention to detail is brilliant but this is not just a Fox showpiece like 2012 was, there is depth to avatar. I just could not see how anyone could dislike this, the 2 and a half hours drifted by and left me wanting more. James Cameron truly is a master of movies.Same based on India lord ""Hanuman Ji"".Perfect movie.Must watch guys"
"This was one of the first major films to use modern 3D stereographic presentation, and did a particularly good job in showcasing the wonders the format could bring. It brought an beautifully rendered alien world, filled with bio- luminescent plants, Roger Dean/Zhangjiajie-esque floating mountains, holographic computer systems, and a wealth of alien creatures, which all looked brilliant with the new 3D effects.It showed how the addition of depth perception could add so much to backgrounds, and while it did indulge in a few gimmicky objects- thrown-out-of-the-screen moments, it wasn't overused.The plot, however, was a big let-down, following the over-used pattern familiar from Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, Ferngully, The Last Samurai, etc. The main villain's character was frustratingly one-dimensional, and it was topped off with a most unimaginative naming of the sought-after mineral 'Unobtanium'"
"I watched Avatar again today after having seen it previously, shortly after it was released in 2009. No complaints on the special effects side; they were superb. But nice visuals alone does not make a good film. Which leads onto the main problem; story.As numerous other posters have stated, anyone that has watched a lot of films will notice the not-so-subtle similarities. This makes the whole film rather predictable and ultimately, boring.Avatar was worth watching, once, but it is not a film that will leave a lasting impression on me, and I have zero desire to watch it again."
"When I first saw the trailer for Avatar, I was immediately impressed with it and decided to check it out. And unlike most movies, the movie lived up to the hype. I found the movie to be highly entertaining and enjoyable. If you are a science fiction fan, I highly recommend you see this film. It's not the highest grossing film for nothing. The movie has incredible visuals that I have not seen in any other film. The way that Pandora is portrayed makes it look like a place that you fully want to immerse yourself in. Over the course of the film, I began to consider that this might be one of the best movies I've seen. Even though the story isn't groundbreaking in the sense of the word, the movie still provides audiences with fleshed-out characters and the plot is satisfactory enough to keep audiences interested. Like I said before, I recommend this film."
"Honestly, this movie put me to sleep. Visual effects aside this movie is mediocre at best. I know that by posting this everyone will call me a troll because of my honest opinion. I never post reviews and barely comment on here at all. Mostly i observe, so please keep the troll comments to yourself. With that being said i would like to say that this story was better when it came out in 1990. What's that you say? oh, you never saw Dances With Wolves? Well if not, watch it. That movie is way better and is exactly the same premise. I'd get into it, but it's better off if you just look at it yourself. I gave this movie a 4 based on visual effects and cgi, other than that....extremely overrated"
"I've avoided this movie for a couple of years because, given what I've heard, there was not much to expect from the story, although the graphics were spectacular. Finally watched it, and indeed, the graphics are impressive. Still a touch on the cartoony side to my eye, but nevertheless, visually arresting.But even though I was prepared for a sophomoric plot, I found it hard to stomach this. With some people it will resound. With the people who despise their own culture, the people who loathe being part of a society that grants power to fools with their votes and consumer dollars, they will really connect with this film. It will also help if they know nothing of anthropology, have a one sided view of history taken straight from a Zinn book, and have never spent more than twenty seconds learning about ecology. And that's fine. There have been more ridiculous stories told, although none more hyped. What personally chaffed me was the portrayal of the military. The film had to have bad guys, I know, but good Lord. I'm biased, I know, but really, I have to mention that it's a parody of real people that would be offensive if it was worth taking seriously. I have overly strong opinions sometimes, I know, but did Cameron have to spend over 300 million to tell a story this vapid? I could go on about how unlikely everything about the last fight scene is from a strategic perspective, or I could point out how culturally horrifying it is that the main character screwed up an important arranged marriage because of his frickin' feelings, but Hollywood makes its bread and butter insisting that love and an aversion to technological progress are sentiments to be overvalued at every turn. It's not surprising, but the reception it has received from people still disturbs me. I want this country to be more environmentally responsible, but I'm still thankful that the 'message' here has been forgotten already.This gets 5 stars from me, on the basis of its graphics, and on the fact that the acting is good by genre standards. The cast did well, and as a director, I have no less respect for Cameron's skill. I just don't care what he has to say, and this film needed far more originality to make up for how absurd much of it really was."
"I watched this movie yesterday. Yeah it has great graphics and stuff like that but this is when the story ends really. No actual meaning. Just another galaxy-fantasy-alien movie. I want to get to the point though. I think that the whole script and plot is based in the world of warcraft storyline of mount hyjal. We got the alien tribe ( night elves dressed up exactly as the draenei ) living peacefully in their forest world, their huge old tree exactly as the tree of the elves in the game. The alien tribe worship an ancient god-like existence Eywa exactly as the elves have Elune in the game. And in both stories the giant tree of life is being attacked by the bad guys and on one hand we have the na'vi and on the other the elves try to save it. There are many flight and earth mounts in the film. So its not a bad thing to admit u made a movie inspired by a video game. Im sure that if the movie was named after the story of WoW with a little change would have more appeal to the crowd. EX ""Battle in mount Pandora"". And as the tagline of the movie says........... Enter the world...of warcraft. PS. I rated the movie 5/10 only for the reason that it has great graphics."
"I did enjoy the visual presentation during the movie, but that was all. I did not really see anything special about this movie and don't understand what is the hype about. The setting, character...etc might be a new idea in the field of movies, but people who do play video games have seen way too much similarities that Avatar presented to us. Starcraft, Warcraft, Command and Conquer, and Fantasy games...I have seen way too much similar setting, so Avatar is not magicial at all, but just cliché to me.And the story, I do not know about the connection with Dance with the Wolf...etc that other people mentioned, but it is totally a rip off from Battle for Terra, which I believe was not a big hit at all so nobody mentioned about it. Battle for Terra story goes like this: Humans found a new planet Terra that Human can settle on, but the planet's air is poison to human, so they need to convert the atmosphere to earth like condition, but Earth like atmosphere is poison to Terra indigenous. Surprisingly, Terra indigenous also love their nature and suck at technology. War break out and Terra indigenous is at the brink of losing, in the end human lost because one of its pilot begin to like the Terra indigenous and decide to backstab human's battleship. Does this story sounds familiar? I think it totally is.In my opinion, Avatar is just a million dollar rip off of video games and small make movies such as Battle for Terra, which the story is so similar that make me doubt Avatar's script was just modified from it."
"I finally got to see the all so acclaimed AVATAR movie. And it was nothing special. I admit, the CGIs were worth every penny, but that's all. Maybe my expectations were to high, but c'mon, this is the guy that made Terminator, The Abyss and Titanic. He has a standard to uphold. I was expecting the story and the action to keep me at the edge of my seat, and... nothing. It actually looked to me like more of a western movie set somewhere into the future. I am sorry, but after seeing it, my only conclusion is that it has its sales only from the fact it has been so hugely promoted that people actually convinced themselves that this actually is that good. I give it a 5 star out of 10 for the effects. If you want to see things go bang go see it, if not stay home."
"I'll give James Cameron credit, Avatar is visually spectacular. But that's all this movie has going for it. It's too long, the characters are one dimensional, the plot is predicable, and said plot has gaping holes in it.This movie could easily have been forty minutes shorter. It dragged often.The characters were all stereotypes, and not one of them ever acted against his stereotype. I was never surprised by any of them.The plot was a string of clichés and contrivances. Some of them were visually surprising, but that was it. Otherwise I was practically able to check them off as they turned up.As for plot holes, I'll mention three: 1)Terraforming three Earthlike planets and bioengineering life to populate them with would be trivial compared to traveling to another star. 2)Ever hear of shaft and drift mining? Go in underneath the native village and they'll never know you're there. 3)Are you capable of interstellar travel and have a surface target to wipe out? Just drop a rock on it from orbit. It's called a kinetic strike."
"The 3D images in this movie are amazing. They keep you entertained from beginning to end, as long as you don't get annoyed too much by all the typical movie clichés and the total lack of interest in the plot.In particular, I don't like the main character of this movie. It's the stereotypical main character of action movies, i.e. an improvised bonehead with a big heart, few words, and a lot of luck. It seems that movie makers usually use this type of unintelligent main characters in order for the audience to identify themselves.I'm looking forward to the day I watch a movie where they put a marine to do a job that requires some qualification and the outcome is a complete failure. It would send a more realistic message."
"See title. Nothing else to say here. My review needs to be a certain length to post. So, this is awkward. What yous up too? I'm just watching telly."
Would be good as a twilight zone episode. Acting was decent and the theme was good but I wouldn't watch it a second time even if I got paid all the money in the world
"This movie sucks. Never have I ever wasted 3 hours of my life on something this bad and this underwhelming. I can understand that the visual effects were good at the time it was made. But now this movie is just plain bad. The acting is so shallow and the plot is incredibly stupid. There's no good reason this movie should have won any Oscars, let alone even have been nominated for any. If someone asked me to see this movie with them, I would call 911. You can't be sure if someone is not insane if they even pretend to like this movie"
"James Cameron, whether you like him or not, certainly knows how to make a big blockbuster and fill it with dazzling visuals and epic thrills. The Terminator and its sequel are 2 of the best science fiction films ever made, while Titanic, despite receiving what might be the biggest backlash of all time, is also a very good movie. Avatar? Not so much. This tale of a human using an avatar to live among an alien race and learn about them has by the sound of it already been done by Disney and Kevin Costner. This is a groundbreaking special effects spectacle, but not much more than that.It's a bit depressing this is the highest grossing movie of all time. There are good reasons why this one's reputation has gone down in recent years. The plot is formulaic but interesting, and the special effects are amazing to look at but the film has a lot of flaws. I don't hate Avatar, but I don't like it much. I get the impression people turned on it after a second viewing. I didn't like it the first time. I watched it again recently and my rating remained the same. It's the most overrated science fiction film of all time in my opinion, and definitely one of the weaker billion dollar movies.In terms of positives, the main thing about this are the visuals. The visual effects are brilliant, and while it can look artificial it still pulls you in. The film is stunning to look at, and most of the acting is pretty good. The standout performance is Zoe Saldana, who's excellent performance as one of the aliens didn't get as much attention as it should have. The film has some interesting themes, which are wasted in favour of visuals but the inclusion of a more drama filled story is appreciated. The scene when the home of the Na'vi is destroyed is genuinely affecting, and there are some good bits.Aside from that, Avatar is all style and almost no substance. Avatar barely feels like a movie. It feels more like James Cameron showing off how good he is at VFX with a vague story thrown in reluctantly. The screenplay is bland and lacking in emotion, while the thought provoking themes are wasted. James Cameron isn't even at full directional power, as every shot goes out of its way to show some scenery and this means some of the action scenes lose tension. Avatar is a work of art and like most modern art, it's weak, soulless and lacking in meaning. I also sure he could have coped with shortening it a bit, as 160 minutes is totally overlong. Don't even get me started on Sam Worthington.Overall, Avatar is a remarkably average film that was hyped to absurd levels and it's utterly outrageous that while The Dark Knight wasn't nominated for best picture, this was. It's a hollow and aside from the effects generic movie and not something many would want to watch more than once (Unfortunately I have). Not a terrible movie, but a huge disappointment and certainly not Cameron at his best."
"The special effects are fascinating, but the characters and plot are as trite as they can be. There's no message here that is not present in many Hollywood westerns, or any film concerning imperialist intrusion into a primitive way of life. To sum it up, If Whitey Wants Your Natural Resources, He'll Tear Up Anything To Get Them. From the 15th to the 19th centuries the world learned this lesson from the Spanish, French, Dutch, Portugese, and English. I laughed out loud when I realized that Giovanni Ribisi's character wasn't kidding when he referred to the object of his mining project as Unobtainium. That word has been used colloquially by motorheads for at least 35 years as a way of referring to any expensive, high- tech metal, especially titanium and magnesium. I don't know whether James Cameron thought he made it up, or if he heard a couple of bikers talking in a parking lot and absorbed it subliminally. Either way, it turned what was intended to be a significant scene into a big chuckle. The only reason I gave this overlong cartoon more than 2 stars is the fact that I admire the effort of the actors, as well as the technical expertise of the CG people. The fact that this was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards tells me that either: (A) the choices that year were few; or (B) the members of the academy have lost all taste and perception. As long as the viewer doesn't expect Avatar to be great cinematic literature. she or he can probably be entertained and not disappointed."
"In the modern world, it is so easy to just give an audience a film composed of a blaze of visuals and sound and make them love it. Avatar is the perfect example of that. The story was so annoyingly predictable and hollow that I ended up believing that it was supposed to insult my intelligence. The characters and the dialog were downright one-dimensional, worn-out and unlikable. Subtleties were nonexistent and there was a constant manipulation of emotions going on. It is so easy to create a classical cinema product. Be humble. Be in love with your project. Be a perfectionist. Be as original as possible. Let us do the thinking during the film. That's about all you need to do. Avatar was just a demonstration. I really wish that the animators' skills were utilized to something else..."
"It certainly is one of the most visually impressive films ever made. The special effects are amazing. The imagination used in the visual effects is incredible. James Cameron has crafted such an impressive film to look at, so why could he not have used this gift to create a screenplay that was more original, that had more depth and that wasn't so predictable? It's still a good story and the film is enormously entertaining, but the script prevents it from achieving that level of greatness that would distinguish it as a truly landmark film. Great score, the art direction and cinematography are superb. It's certainly memorable and good performances from everyone."
"In 1956 The Academy Award for best picture was given to a very boring movie called ""Marty"". In that same year BAFTA awarded the incredibly well done Richard III with Lawrence Olivie the best picture award. In that same year we had Bad Day At Black Rock, and arguably the best movie of all time La Strada as well. Again and again the Academy of Motion Picture Artists fails to recognize true genius in favor of some politically popular statement. This year they did it again favoring a cute little Iraqi War film tribute to the poor unfortunate soldiers who have been unfortunate enough top be sucked into this idiotic conflict over a film that will be remembered for a thousand years longer, Avatar. In Avatar, the creator, James Cameron has given Hollywood and the entire movie industry a new art form. It is as much of an experience as a movie and it has a storyline I would rank head and shoulders over any of its many competitors. But, alas, it was not a war movie or a ""cause celeb"" movie so the ill informed of Hollywood chose to ignore it in favor of a much lessor movie. What a shame that the first woman to win the award for direction will know for ever after that in fact she received it as a token."
"Amazing. I don't know where to start. The CGI,action,romance, cinematography,directing,writing,everything is perfect. Everything is so detailed. James Cameron has created a masterpiece. The world of Pandora is so detailed and colorful, it almost feels as if it's real. The characters are likable even though it seems James Cameron spent more time developing the Na'vi characters than the human ones. The emotional part of the movie is like Cameron's previous movie, Titantic. It has the same romantic style. The Military or mercs remind me of Cameron's other movie, Aliens. The only problem I had with it was the acting was a little weak. But still this is a feast for the eyes and heart.Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of the year and probably in my top 20 of all time. Movies will never be the same. I saw it twice in theaters(both in 3D and bought the DVD and Blu-Ray the day it came out. I was very surprised to find out it's actually better on an HD TV."
"I really liked the movie; it's entertaining and incredibly visually attractive, regardless of any message or politics. But - the DVD is fullscreen, which has the effect of zooming in on the picture, resulting in a significant loss of scenery and face closeups cutting off the tops of their heads. I can only imagine this is a marketing ploy, and the full theatrical screen version will be released later, so many people will end up buying two DVD's. Since there are already news articles claiming a summer re-release of the film in theaters, and another DVD release later in the year, I'm betting this is what will happen. If you haven't got the DVD yet, I'd recommend waiting for the real thing. I fell into this trap, but only once; I'll never buy another new release till I see it on screens in stores. By now, this movie should be demonstrated in every store selling TV's, so you should be able to see what I mean before buying it."
"warning, spoilers:One of the best movies ever made, avatar is an excellent movie with a great message we should accept, that we would usually just fight for something we want, and we fight for it , even though its already claimed. Unlike what others say, it had a good plot, which was that Jake sully had to earn the trust of the navi,and tell them to move out, but war breaks out and so on. Another thing many have complained about is why the movie never mentions why the humans have come for the unobtanium, but if you paid attention o what Jake said in one scene, he says that the humans have destroyed their mother (refering to earth), and what he meant is that the humans have probably destroyed earth by pollution etc. Also in the ending if you paid attention, Jake also said that the humans had to return to their DYING PLANET. this movie deserves all the credit, and is powerful and emotional."
"Really, it was that crap. Except for the IMAX 3D and passable acting this movie actually sucked. You've seen it all before. Its not a movie, its a rehash of every cliché of every other movie Hollywood has ever mad but now its in space.Yes, I know that it has grossed a zillion dollars and surpassed his other piece of crap today but that's no excuse. We are suckers, plain and simple.Its all predictable with no surprises from the hero to the villain. This movie is all about the ride and too bad the ride ain't that grand. See it because its a spectacle but avoid it if your really into movies and want to see art. Its an event not a good movie."
"I was as excited about this movie as anybody else. Love James Cameron, love big blockbusters... Sadly, I was very, very disappointed. Granted, the visual effects are outstanding and brilliant. That's it. The storyline was completely predictable and unoriginal. I was bored out of my brain the whole time, and not even the outstanding effects could entice me into the lame plot of this film. Anyone who has ever seen the movie Fern Gully will see that this movie was one of identical storyline, just with added special effects and a (lame) touch of sci-fi. Sam Worthington was so bad with his accent and bad voice overs I was cringing in my seat. As a Cameron fan, I was extremely disappointed with this film. It relied only on effects and the importance of some creativity and originality in terms of storyline was forgotten. Sad, very sad. Then again, the whole vampire-meets-girl-oh-this-is-so-wrong-but-so-right saga is getting old... Insert: blue-person-meets-human-oh-this-is-so-wrong-but-so-right storyline... wow, it's a whole new genre... Not."
"After endless hype by many of Cameron's fans, Avatar has finally arrived and it's a HUGE disappointment.First of all, the CGI looks pretty good, but it's not the ""gamechanger"" people were expecting, the CGI still looks like CGI Secondly, this ""script"" is one of the most juvenile story lines ever written, as if a kid wrote it and gave it to Cameron along with it's record $300 million budget.Third, this movie is downright BORING for over two hours. All we get is two Na'vis looking around on Pandora, and him learning more about how they live.Fourth, the final fight looks like something out of a video game, with most of the main characters killed off in a weak attempt to make an anti-war film.Fifth, Cameron wants it both ways, he wants an anti-war film, but yet, he filmed his final fight as a way to excite the audience after enduring two long boring hours of his slow movie.All in all, I like James Cameron, but I did not like Avatar at all. Easily Cameron's worst movie! This is simply Ferngully: The Last Rainforest in 3D!"
"I'm afraid that my viewpoint on this film will not be from a technical standpoint with references to other great films, actors or directors. I can only speak with the voice of one who has walked this Earth for over half a century and after listening to Democrats and Republicans for most of that time I have seen that both sides to any argument can document their ideas to the nth degree. This film was designed to provoke an emotional response from start to finish and it does so to a degree I have not experienced before. The writing, the acting, the CG panorama and the technical excellence of the 3D all combine to make this story the new benchmark in film entertainment. Kudos to Mr. Cameron and the whole team for shocking this old man to tears.Plus the fact that Ms. Weaver is so gorgeous, doesn't hurt at all..."
"Have you seen Pocahontas? I have. Have you also seen The Matrix? I once again have, and I am sure that most of you out there also have and liked more or less both of them. But what was that James Cameron managed coming up with the idea for Avatar in 1994 by way of mixing together the two cornerstones of both the above movies was to unsuccessfully reproduce one of the most uninspired stories of all time! Of course The Matrix came in 1999, but I am pretty sure that the basic idea had being laying out there for at least the five previous years. Pocahontas in Avatar: Neytiri the beautiful, but in order for us to say wow this is different, also blue girl lives on the planet Pandora (New Word) which is kind of being invaded by Parker Selfridge (Jhon Smith), who has the ulterior motive of destroying the way of life of the natives (natives) in order to acquire the precious material of their land. (Gold)Jhon Smith in Avatar: Jake Sully is, surprise-surprise, the at first invader but who later falls in love with the native girl: Neytiri (Pocahontas); and again for us to say wow this is different he is also on a wheelchair.And the wheelchair brings us to The Matrix in Avatar: Yeah because when the metal stick enters the back of your head, or when you lie in a capsule then your avatar can walk again or gain inapprehensible strength and fighting skills. So if you are looking for a meaningful movie do not, I repeat do not, watch this one. Now if what you are looking for is to find out how can 240000000 dollars be spent on some of the best ever visual effects out there, then yes you should watch this one, unless of course you have something better to do. So I am giving Avatar a 10 out of 10 for the pleasure it has offer to my eyeballs, but because this was never the sole motive for me to watch a movie I am actually giving it a 5 out of ten, since both The Matrix and Pocahontas were good movies plus this one added the awesome effects. Congratulations Cameron you rightfully win the award for the most meaningless spending of such a lot of money."
"As far as the story of this film goes--I was rather disappointed. Why do you ask? That's simple. I've seen this movie before--TWICE! Maybe you've heard of them: ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""FernGully"". If you've seen those two movies, you've seen ""Avatar"". From a story standpoint, anyhow.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 rating was because of the visualizations. I'll be humble and give Cameron's mind credit on that one. The effects, visuals, and ground-breaking scenery were quite breath-taking at times and extraordinarily conceived.However, with a film that is nearly 3 hours long--I, personally, need something more than a film that has an entertaining ""acid"" trip as it were with a story that I've seen at least twice from films that were just as entertaining."
"*sigh* I am not going to survive the endless hoard of fans who defend this Sci-Fi. I was going to avoid this film originally, but my friends got me to. so I found it and gave it a try. I tried to like it, I tried to FORCE myself to like this, but the bull crap plot, the liberal messaging, and the stupid characters really didn't do it for me.First off, yes, Pandora looks stunning. Its really beautiful. But special effects does not make a good film, not by a long shot. My biggest grip with Avatar was it's story. To those who say that this film has an original story, that is a bold faced lie. I am sorry but this story has been done. It has Disney's Pochahontas, Dances with Wolves, and hell even Fearngully's plot lines littered all over the place, and when left to what little originality there is, the film just bored the hell out of me.My next grip are all the democratic, lefty liberal messaging, you know; ""America bad"" ""Natives good"" or how about all the subliminal spitting in the face of our soldiers anyone? This film was basically an uppercut to our soldiers who returned from Vietnam. Its been said by a few and I agree.The characters are not much better. Most of them are cardboard cut outs with little personality. And all of them are annoying, from the ""Oh so perfect Navi"" to the cliché American villain who wants to mine the moon of Pandora for ""Unobtainium"". The Navi think there perfect, there full of themselves and claim that all humans are evil. while the cliché villains claim that there is no intelligent life form on Pandora. I was expecting the humans to leap out and start singing ""Savages"".If you like Avatar, fine, don't accuse me of lacking imagination or creativity because that is just plain rude. I am part of a minority I understand, with that being said I dub Avatar by James Cameron the most overrated film I have ever seen."
"It's sad to see a film with this much hype being nothing but a copy of another movie i.e. FernGully: The Last Rainforest (1992).Yes Avatar is slightly different as its been modified and is set in the future but if you look at both movies you will see that they are basically the same in idea and in plot.Lets also look at the special effects, everyone is calling it the best special effects yet. Other than the 3D which is only clear in the foreground and has no depth and makes everything in the background blurry, there is nothing different to what other films are using, there is nothing new. Guys save your money and wait till its in the bargin bin at your local DVD store.No I'm not bitter, just Disappointed"
"Worthy of an Oscar? in what area? Acting is o.k. but nothing special. Plot is worthy of a Saturday matinée movie. Animation nothing special. 3D effects far from spectacular. Star Wars many years ago was better without requiring glasses. Costumes? Music is not bad, but not great. If there was an Oscar for money wasted, it would qualify. Occasionally there is a movie that is so bad that it becomes good. Unfortunately this even misses out on that score. I am a sci-fi fan from way back, but there are no redeeming qualities in this movie. All I can imagine is that the multi-millions spent on Avatar have embarrassed the public into believing that it must be good. It will be interesting to see if the non 3d DVD is anywhere near as popular. I think not."
"Technically a very impressive movie with some great special effects. Whenever the people were placed in the fake world it actually looked compelling but when the not-so-convincing Navi were there it looked like CGI.The flaws in the story made this movie absurd! The guy is using a putter from today, the movie is in 3-D but the monitors of 2154 are not, we cannot drill sideways even though that is currently done all the time and for goodness sakes he calls a rock unobtanium. Too many flaws to call this a classic - it falls somewhere between True Lies and The Abyss on Cameron's list and below at least four other movies he has done! It should be seen for the visuals and that is it!"
"Predictable, at best! We have seen this storyline hundreds of times and it was wasted with technology that didn't make it any better. I am sorry I took my family to see this and I will be sure to never seen a James Cameron film again.It is hard to remember the names of the characters or the location of the planet that this took place on. The military was portrayed in a typical setting of waste and bad decisions.Just like Titanic, this move was over hyped and very predictable even though it was all fiction. Come on, 10ft. tall blue beings that spoke a language that nobody understood and had to be translated.I could go on and on but I think you get my point."
"After all the hype surrounding Avatar, I was ready to be impressed. Boy, was I disappointed. The fact that this movie beat Inglourious Basterds at the Golden Globes is a travesty. Where is the substance in movies these days? Screenwriters are now allowed to pass off the same recycled garbage as a script and it is getting old. And apparently having a big flashy movie is all you need. Predictable, lame stories are the norm.I wanted to love this movie, but through the 1.5 hours i could actually stomach, I was bored to tears. This movie used any excuse to have some big stupid chase scene just because it looks cool. Avatar felt like it was chasing its own tail the whole time. If you want to see a visually stunning movie that does nothing to stimulate the mind... see Avatar. I personally wish I could have my 14 dollars back. Should have waited for DVD"
"I was so excited to see this I almost cried when my boyfriend went without me. When I finally went, I got there an hour early to get perfect seats and could barely sit still.Oh my god. The first twenty minutes were so boring I almost fell asleep. All the human characters were overly abrasive. The military leader...guy... was so harsh and unrealistic as a human being that I literally laughed every time he opened his mouth.Then the glowing colors and enchanting landscapes of Pandora finally appeared. Amazing visual effects. 3D glasses make me want to puke, but it was worth it. Very cool.But after another twenty minutes of that, I was ready to leave the theater. I've already seen Pocahontas...so...Plus I didn't really understand why the Navi were preaching peace and being 'one with nature', while they themselves were quite violent towards one another. Kind of weird. This movie, if placed under a microscope, has about a hundred plot holes and inconsistencies that left me quite skeptical in my seat. But hey, if you want to stare at cool visuals and not really pay attention to the story, you might just love this. Its pretty entertaining in that sense."
"I am not going to insist on the technical prowess and creativity of this film. The special effects, both visual and sound, are superb, sublime, perfect, the merger of Star Wars and Matrix, of all the best means ever devised to make our eyes and ears believe the unbelievable. James Cameron is a god of sorts in that field and he used the most advanced studios to produce a divine and magical fairy tale. Anyone who pretends to love the cinema cannot and must not ever be reluctant in the slightest way to go and watch that film, two or three times if possible. And James Cameron is just as good when he deals with the surreal and supernatural of this extra-terrestrial civilization and when he exposes the brutality and human underdevelopment with no hope to ever be emerging from their dumbness of both military higher-ups and greedy industrialists. To list and explain all the allusions to all the films you can and will recognize would need two hundred pages. So I will pass and trust your own knowledge to enjoy the many allusions. I want to insist on the central message of the film, both ideological and cultural. Americans arriving on this planet finds a humanoid species, both intelligent and developed, but in a direction that has kept and exploited the direct relation that every individual can entertain with the beasts of nature and the telluric or subterranean forces of nature seen as the mother of the equilibrium without which nothing can survive. The only aim of the Americans is to recuperate some ore that is in great quantities under the main home-tree of this species, under all the sacred places and natural temples of this civilization, and to use brutal force if necessary to clear the area. Greed and death instinct are the two teats on which all these Americans have been fed. Genetic science makes it possible to invest the personality of a human into the genetically modified cloned body of a local humanoid, producing a spy who is to get into this community and bring back the information necessary for the military genocide while his human body is kept in some hibernating pod. The problem with that project is that the happy few who can thus get into that community fall in love with their civilization, their culture, their deep human feelings and their absolute cult of prowess, courage and intelligence invested in the full respect of mother nature. Eventually for one of them that love will mean falling in love with the daughter of the political (father) and religious (mother) leaders of the tribe. James Cameron is a genius in the way he depicts the strong human emotions on the American side, both negative and positive and this depicting is immediately effective on us who are well trained in reading, receiving and experiencing these emotions. We feel the full horror James Cameron wants us to feel in front of the ugly conquistador colonel and the admirable courage of this female marine who prefers betraying her camp to being part of a planned genocide. James Cameron tries hard to depict in the same way the extra-terrestrial feeling and emotions of these humanoids, both real and cloned, but there we feel them less because they are different and we are not in phase with them, especially since the special effects are making us slightly blind. But it remains absolutely sublime. The meaning here is that of the meeting of two human species and their divided objectives on both sides. It is the merging of the two species in order to produce collaboration, cooperation, exchange and even total gift of culture, technological power, natural knowledge, spiritual representations, and all other common or different domains. In other words we are dealing with the fascination of the other. Some call that inverted racism or mixing cultures, salad bowl or melting pot, integration or assimilation. But James Cameron shows us how that approach is dangerous and fatal for the weaker species who will always be the victim of the stronger species, understood as being the Americans who have no word of honor when greed is in play. At the same time if we do not respect the other in its total personality, religion and religious beliefs included, we will only produce a genocide, be it at least a cultural genocide teaching English and imposing our culture, and negating the natural evolution of the differentiation of languages, the punishment of the tower of Babel in our religious lore. James Cameron is telling us a parable more than a fable, and he is in perfect line with the deepest Judeo-Christian tradition of ours, of the Christ who was rabbi Jesus before being crucified. That deepest belief of ours is called love: to love the other in his or her difference and to give to that other all we have and share it with him or her, expecting the same attitude on the other side but at the same time refusing violence in the other case and loving our ""enemies"" as much as our ""friends"". In other words, and to cut short a long story, this film is the First Gospel after Barack Hussein Obama's election, even if that new spiritual approach of the world did not produce a miracle in Copenhagen. The Second Gospel of this Obama era will be the announced film by Steven Spielberg on the last novel by Stephen King, Under the Dome. After Saint James, the first Bishop of Jerusalem and the elder brother of Jesus in the end stoned to death at the foot of the wall of Jerusalem, we will have Saint Stephen, the Protomartyr of Christianity, stoned to death on the encouragement of Saul of Tarsus, the future Paul.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"
"Every so often a movie captures your heart and mind; Avatar does just that. The twelve year wait for Cameron's fantasy feature was well worth it in every sense of the word. I saw the movie at midnight and as soon as the credits popped up at the end of the movie I immediately wanted to watch it again. Words cannot describe the beauty of this movie, both in scenery and story. Whether or not you enjoy watching fantasy movies, you must go see it. Hopefully Cameron is already preparing to make a sequel. I thought that the blue people would be initially hard to swallow, but they have a sense of beauty to them that you can only get by getting connected to these ""people"" from the story and every thing that makes them and the movie interesting."
"James Cameron said that Avatar would change the landscape of cinema forever, and after seeing the film last night, I have to agree. The film looks INCREDIBLE. People have complained about the amount of money James Cameron spent on the film, but it was honestly worth every single cent. Visually, i don't think there is a film superior to it. Not only is the CGI realistic, it's detailed, it's colorful and it looks gorgeous. However, the CGI helps the movie and story propel. The actors are not weighted down and, even in the form of 9 foot tall blue aliens, Worthing and Saldana give terrific performances and a believable romance. There will be those who complain that the story is unoriginal, but I don't think that's what James Cameron is trying to do. He wants us to experience the same types of stories but in a far improved format. There will quibbles about the occasional line of clunky dialogue or clichés but these are minor errors. As a whole, the film is a remarkable experience, and make sure you a) see it on the biggest screen you can find and b) see it on 3D because it really does transport you to the new world. As Jake Sully says in the film's teaser, ""this is GREAT."""
"In typical James Cameron fashion this was an utterly visually stunning masterpiece! Not watching this film in 3D at a cinema would deny the film the justice it deserves. This film, more than any other in history, transforms the audience into a different world.The story itself is solid, although at times predicable. However the central characters remain interesting and engaging. The acting is strong, without being brilliant. However the villain is perhaps overly simplistic and slightly one-dimensional. The story combines drama and action, which is not always a good combination - in this case though, it just works.Overall an absolute MUST SEE! In years to come this film will be reflected upon for its revolutionary special effects and its role in establishing a new era of cinema viewing. Do yourself a favour and absorb yourself in the world of Avatar."
"After over a decade since the film 'Titanic' became the highest grossing film of all time and placed itself in-between Ben-Hur & Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King for the most academy awards ever won by a single film, James Cameron returns to bring the audience 'AVATAR' a film rumoured to be more expensive than any other film (if so it would be the third time Cameron has broken the record) and is claimed to be a revolution in 3-D technology and visual effects. And after all the hype and media attention Cameron has given us a brilliant film, well told and brilliantly crafted. Cameron's direction is perfect and confident, after allowing the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich to try and direct large action films he returns to show them how a master does it. The acting is superb and supported by the incredible visual effects, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver's performances all shine through the blue creatures known as the Na'vi. The visual effects are incredible and if Avatar - likely to see a best picture nomination as well - does not sweep the technical categories it will be a joke on the Oscars, worse than the Golden Compass winning visual effects over Transformers. James Horner's third collaboration with Cameron as a composer is once again a triumph and while I still prefer the Titanic soundtrack, his music is a perfect blend of Aliens, Titanic and original music that you have never heard before. The pacing is wonderful and nothing short of an epic and if I had a problem it was only with the dialogue. I would prefer if James Cameron wrote the screen story but co-wrote the screenplay with someone else. The film is certainly a milestone and should definitely be seen."
This might be the best movie i've seen in years. I just saw it in 3D (in Germany...we did get a head start this time). The movie looks twice as expensive as the very poor Transformers 2 but cost about the same money. OK you get your 'standard' characters but the story is so perfectly told that you forget about that. Cameron didn't even forget to put something in for his old fans (True Lies is all I'm going to say...lol). It's incredible how real the Navi look. The other effects are perfect too. Wow! This movie even beats Peter Jackson's trilogy and i hope there will be more Avatar movies in the not too distant future. I advise all of you to go and see this perfect movie.
Well i just happened to see the screening of avatar as i work with movies. We happened to get avatar and I must say the movie delivers...Not just on an aspect of story telling and intense moments but on pure entertainment and visual bliss. I am not much into Hollywood movies but for James Cameron I will make the exception of writing this review. It is just what the doctor ordered for this year of pathetic Hollywood movies. I just cant wait to watch it in 3D the following weekend but James Cameron still hasn't lost his masterful touch.Its great to see how the movie turns out to be so great and the way in which the plot turns.I wont give away anything and the plot is pretty much explained in the previews that you would have definitely seen. Just remember the cgi is brilliant and Cameron yet again has given us a glimpse of tomorrow today.
"James Cameron takes you on a virtual reality journey in this movie - within a few mins of reaching planet Pandora in the movie, you'll forget you are looking at special effects and get immersed in the world he's created for you. A lot was stressed on the lack of a strong storyline here, but when the special effects are like this, you have no time to ponder about the story. The script and acting are superb - both by the actors and the na'vi characters. But the strength of this experience lies in the world Cameron takes you to - the sights and sounds are realistic beyond compare. This is not your ordinary computer graphics - this is one of the very rare cases where special effects will make it more of a journey than just a movie. It is also a film where 3D really shines. Till now, 3D was the forte of animation movies. Here, 3D will bring you uncannily close to realism..."
"The fact that this film is doing so well and is receiving so many adoring reviews is sad. It clearly demonstrates the banality that has seemingly permeated global culture. The story of Avatar, from structure and dialogue, to character development, is amazingly inept and shockingly predictable. It is replete with cliché, lack of creativity, heavy-handed misinformed propaganda, and blatant stereotypes catering to the most unsophisticated of intellects. If you walk away from this film feeling as if it actually put forth meaningful allegorical commentary on matters political, sociological, ecological, or historical of any kind, then you are a simple, naive idiot or have the intellect of a pre adolescent child.For an example of a much more sophisticated approach to relevant social commentary you'd be better advised to watch District 9.I know this all sounds rather harsh. Deal with it because I speak the truth. Yes, this film will generate a sequel or two and studios will throw a ton of money at attempts to capitalize on its success by ripping it off. After all, Avatar itself is a blatant rip-off of previous films; most apparent, Dances With Wolves. In fact, a quick reference to Dances With Wolves will summarize about 50% of the story. The other 50% is comprised of misguided stereotypes of capitalism, a military that simply serves as a means of advancing capitalism at the expense of the indigenous cultures, western imperialism, and ridiculous new age noble savage nonsense.However, the real travesty of this horrible film is that, at no time, was I ever surprised while watching it. There was not one plot point, twist, character action/evolution, etc, that I didn't see coming a mile away. The story, from beginning to end, was utterly predictable."
"Mr. Cameron...what can I say? You've done it again!James Cameron creates the world of Pandora, inhabited by the humanoid creatures known as ""the Na'vi"", and several other creatures made by some of the greatest special effects the world has ever seen - something only James Cameron could do.To clear up some confusion first: most people are asking ""What's the avatar"" and ""how does he become it"". The avatar that Jake has is a genetic replication of one of the Na'vi that is mixed with human DNA to look like him (actually his twin brother...long story, see the movie). Once he is linked for the first time, he becomes one with his avatar. He is put into a machine, ad he is linked to his Avatar, wherever it may be. Whenever Jake (as the avatar) falls asleep, he wakes up as Jake (as a human). He is then eventually sent back by being put into the machine. Now, the movie is over 2 hours. I will admit, the first hour or so is a little slow, but it is definitely enough to keep your interest. Once the jailbreak scene occurs, be prepared for seeing one of the greatest movies of all time. The second part more than makes up for the somewhat slow start to what turned out to be an amazing motion picture I know I will watch again and again. Thanks to James Cameron for this amazing film experience.(PS...See it in 3-D if you can.)10/10 - Go see it...now! Don't just sit there...go now!"
"Normally I would give this film 6.5 (as for kids 8.5) but i'm giving 1 because there are too many people voting 10, which astonished me. I didn't enjoy movie much , I guess I have thing called expectation and I've seen a lot of good movies . But I tried to realize what was the thing that made all these people feel so well to give it 10. I guess they felt like me watching titanic for the very first time. Movie itself is very predictable , naive but spectacular .Avatar - movie for kids. It has too many holes ,but people believe that new technology and a lot of money can buy you everything. I'm certain that 5 - 6 years after this move won't get more than 7 from most people."
"If you're someone who enjoys movies made by Tim Burton, which are heavier on atmosphere and visuals than actual story, this movie is for you. If your someone who enjoys a good story with good acting and writing, than don't even bother watching this.This movie is mediocre to the last degree. The acting is extraordinarily bad, and the writing is bland. This is an extremely overrated motion picture using great visuals and picture to make money, a sad example of what's happened to film, it's no longer to entertain, but it seems it's more of a contest of who can make more money. Do not watch."
"Well here we are, more than a year after the general release of ""Avatar"". Most of the hype has finally dissipated, exposing it to be a wasteland of ultra-liberal elitist fantasy fueled by some of the most pernicious corporate greed. Cameron would call it ""film promotion"". Let's call it what it really is: propaganda. An example of Madison Avenue manipulation at its worst. Marketing research - not to discover what audiences (a.k.a target market) need or want - but to ascertain their weaknesses and exploit them. No need to assess this film's shortcomings - most have been adroitly expressed on this site and elsewhere. At this point, I'd like to consider the possible re-purposing of this cinematic Edsel. Is it possible to use this film to make Avatar anti-toxin?Millions of minions worldwide have drunk this hemlock and passed it to others, saying ""Drink this - you'll be superior"". The promise is as sophomorically volatile as the drink itself. There's never been a shortage of vapid impostors of spiritual truth gift-wrapped in gold foil. Maybe, this time, Avatar's industrial-scale superficiality has finally helped pop culture's implosion to reach critical mass. I cite the many reactions (no pun intended) on this very site as support for this hypothesis. There's witnesses a-plenty to this film's naked arrogance and, perhaps more importantly, realization that an attempt was being made to bilk and corrupt them with a mixture of sweet, salty, and sour distractions. Read these analyses. They're not simply whining about being cool or not enough skin or more blood. They recognize that the film is, at its core, a total VACUUM. After being told of its wonders, it's not simply inadequate - it is nothing at all. Many are realizing that not only was this a banal waste of effort, but it is built and based upon a ziggerat of nothingness. These victims of Avatar are awakening from being tranquilized - and it's not pleasant to realize you've been swindled while you were incapacitated. Powerful antidote is illumination...powerful antidote.Thank you, Avatar. You probably never realized how effective a dispersant you are against the current trend of plot less, character- devoid, dialogue-deprived, humor-starved, anti-creativity films and theatre. Keep up the bad work."
"The irony of having to tick the may contain spoilers box is rife; and certainly not lost on me. For anyone else that was genuinely blown away by this film please watch something else, anything else! ""Mr Bean"" for instance ,god even an episode of ""Days of our lives"" will suffice. Anything in which to have a reference point and obviously it doesn't need to be good! Firstly this film only warranted a 5/10 purely on the technical prowess of WETA studios(the magicians behind ""Lord of the Rings""), who are 100% responsible for this films success. This film is ""Fern Gully"" right down to the last detail. James Cameron should be SUED!!!!!Certainly not revered by what at best are simply ill informed people and at worst are the most ignorant sheltered troglodytes ever to have existed (Darwin would have been so happy, if only you presented yourselves a little earlier; and I seriously doubt that the majority of you will even get the reference. Hence why this film has such a high rating.) Now I absolutely accept other comparisons that people have drawn ""Dances with Wolves""etc. But this film IS ""Fern Gully""! Lets begin. A boy without purpose just doing whatever is suggested takes a job in a forest (Pandora, such an original name) spray painting red X's on trees to signify there impending harvest. He comes close to one of the natives (i.e. the Nav'i),in this case a Fern Gully fairy, and recognizing her only as a bug getting in the way of his job ,he tries to kill her. The fairy reacts by shrinking the human boy to the size of a fairy. He runs , he plays ,he acts like a 2 year old and ,yes, attracts some predatory organisms nearly getting everyone killed. Oh how the fairy's are both fascinated and fearful of this new addition to there colony. Never fear though because the female fairy, who first shrunk the boy, takes him on a journey of self discovery. He learns how everything is connected i.e. he carves a love heart in a tree professing his adoration for the girl fairy which she reacts to in utter horror. ""Can't you feel it's pain!"" and so on and so on. Through out this ""journey"" we see the wonders of a neon forest which lights up at night, pretty floating organisms and, yes, even a scene where they frolic about as the earth lights up with their touch. Now this girl fairy is the spiritual successor to the fairy colony(Any of this sounding familiar at this point).Now enter the lead male fairy who is to be married off to the female spiritual successor fairy and become the new ""chief"" leader of the colony( please tell me this is starting to sound familiar). Who at first has nothing but contempt for this outsider but soon they come to respect one another as they fight together to save their home blah, blah, and another exhausted blah! Now this is where the similarities just get ridiculous. The evil impending corporates , which are represented by an evil smog and a large yellow harvesting machine (yes that was not a typo a large yellow harvesting machine! can't imagine where iv'e seen that before?Lol.) This machine is getting closer and closer to the sacred tree (yes a giant tree in which the fairy's all live and is their most referred and sacred landmark. Why does that sound so familiar?Lol). The newly introduced human, now the size of a fairy and living amongst the colony, is now revealed to have been in league with the evil corporate harvesters.At this point the lead female fairy and the human boy are, of course, in love. We laugh, we cry and all that blah! He ultimately comes back to help in the fight and prove his love and loyalty utilizing his knowledge of human machines and riding (now wait for it) ""Batty"" the largest untamable flying creature in ""Fern Gully"". All the rest fly on standard size beetles once they have earn't the right in an initiation, of course! now at this point in ""Avatar"" the Freudian in me was wetting it's self. He has the biggest ""one"" oh how that must make him the alpha male?! The spiritual elder and current chief sacrifice themselves to save the younger fairies and their sacred ""big tree"". The young spiritual successor fairy now the lead spiritual fairy draws all her strength and calls on all the creatures of fern gully to aid in the fight. The human boy uses his ""human intellect"" to shut down the big yellow harvester and puts an end to the evil black smog. Not before ,however, much damage is done to there home. Please tell me that someone out there at this point sees ""some"" similarities? Their have been 2 ""Fern Gully"" sequels I wonder if they too will be plagiarized by the ""talented"" James Cameron.Now I could, of course, go on; further breaking down the similarities. Showing in more detail how this symbolizes that etc. But for those who are fans ,I doubt it will matter, and for the rest of us ,well lets face it, we're smart enough to figure it out. Normally this would not bother me but after hearing endless praise for this film and reading quotes from other IMDb critics ,such as ""Not since ""Schindlers list"" have I been so moved by a film"" etc, I felt I had to say something. I hope that someone else out there will read this and realize they are not alone. It would seem we suffer from ""have a measurable I.Q syndrome!"" it's a condition I'm happy to have. Even if it means I can't enjoy ""al da prutty pictas""!""UNOBTANIUM"" That really should have been enough."
"i watched this yesterday and i was really disappointed, i cannot see what people see in this movie. the story makes no sense at all, all the characters are really clichéd, and the whole movie is ridiculously predictable.especially the plot element with the marine being in a wheelchair feels really forced, seeing some guy in a wheelchair in a spaceship between walking mecha-robots felt unreal, even more unreal than the sigourney weaver character smoking inside a tech lab 150 years in the future...as for the visuals, they might be the best effects to date, but the world of pandora still doesn't look real. it has a computer-gamish look on it, and since the whole storyline is like something someone wrote down in 10 minutes for a computer game, i couldn't help but feeling like i was watching some game trailer."
"It's got something for everyone, romanticized compassion with love for ""Mother Earth"" for the gals, and lots of mechanical high-tech blow-ups, blow-outs....for the guys. It isn't too mushy and it doesn't beat you over the head with PC....it's great fun for everyone. Just go for the sheer joy of the paintings....and the special effect worlds...gorgeous. It's story is familiar (A Man called Horse/Dances with Wolves) but updated for the future, when man is heading out to other planets...warnings....about human attitudes.Horner's music is luscious as usual, with shades of Titanic, Legends of the Fall...and Trek...combined. Worth every penny spent on it. Can't wait for more films of this type....with more story line."
"""WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS"" This movie has got to be one of the worst sci fi films I have ever seen. The reasons why I hate it so much is because, It had NO STORY AT ALL, its mostly cg, and it was WWWAAAYYY over praised. One of the greatest movies of all time, I don't think so. So basically these humans travel to a moon called Pandora to get a mineral called UNOBTAINIUM, wow,When they said James Cameron wrote the script in 1 week, they weren't kidding. So the humans send one of their own to befriend the NaVi, and get them to move from their tree house. The humans destroy the tree and then the humans and aliens fight and aliens win. HOW PREDICTABLE. The reasons this crap became the highest grossing movie of all time was, IT WAS IN 3D, Every dam critic on the planet called it a masterpiece, and it was directed by James Cameron. Ohhhh yes, the most dumb part of the movie was that it was longest movie ever made. If uve seen the 2 min trailer, uve seen the movie. Guess they HAD to have maximum ""oh amazing"" time. Why does everyone love this poor excuse for a movie? If you ask me, people are too entertained by ""pretty colors"". No Story=garbage,I wish I could have given this a 0 it really sucked! If you want a REAL sci fi movie watch DARK CITY AVATARD(0/10)"
"First of all, this movie should not of been 3 hours. I fell asleep for an hour and thought 2 hours was too much, I can't imagine three.I found this movie incredibly unoriginal, The fact that I fell asleep for 1/3rd of the movie, and watched it as if I missed nothing speaks on how inventive this movie was.I'm the type of person that enjoys movies for the plot, and this was not one of the movies for me. This movie was all about effects and getting lost in an alternate reality. If you are not set and ready to experience that, then prepare for a huge waste of time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I thought it was the worst movie I saw in 2009."
"Unless you don't care about anything but graphic's, stay home. This is an animated film with voices of actors who you get to see for about 10 minutes. Story - Boy mets girl. Boy nearly looses girl. Get's girl and lives in paradise forever. Actors - Can't comment. I didn't see them long enough to know if they were any good or not. Graphics - Good to look at as long as you don't look to closely. Plagiarism - Almost every boy/girl A or B grade film you've ever see. Zulu's and all Africa animals should sue. Cost of making film - Ridiculous Conclusion - Ego gone rampant without an original idea INCLUDING 3D. Wasted time, money and actors abilities. Bored to death anyone who wants some originality with the story. James Cameron should never be allowed near a camera again if this is the rubbish he is going to put out."
"The special effects were enjoyable but the film really lacked substance. The tribal nature of the ""smurfette"" blue aliens closely resembled the tribal peoples of earth in quasi montage of African and Red-Indian semiotics permeating throughout the images and customs and even accents. Cameron then very subtly adds animated nippled breasts and other body parts to guarantee the titillation of a massive audience of young males and I even heard male teenagers commenting on these aspects as we left the Cinema as well as general feedback from this group. It is beyond credibility that the Americans depicted as the evil military complex invading a planet and destroying all that is natural would have in that context would have completely annihilate this small tribe of only a few thousand using biological warfare let alone incendiary missiles. They certainly would not have allowed the far fetched experiments of mind transformation into biological clones especially using a crippled marine. If the mineral cost 20 million for kilogram one wonders what the hell it was used for. The whole film was ridiculous and pathetic. To all you lovers of this movie I am so glad I am separated from you tasteless fools with this film. Sam Worthington emerges as yet another expressionless ugly Australian actor who has used his families wealth to hit the big time.Of course the film has been a great financial success but so is Macca's hamburgers proving once again that junk food and films are gratifying to the masses but really lacking in true wholesome substance."
"In Avatar, a bunch of marines in a big spacecraft (with a rotating segment - Aliens) are woken from hyper-sleep (Alien) and drop shipped to a new planet (Aliens) in a vehicle with a snub-nosed cockpit (Aliens). The planet is inhabited by ten-foot tall blue aliens (Battlefield Earth) who worship a big tree (Pochahontas) One of the marines is able to mix in with the natives (Ferngully) and comes to love them. The native culture glows as does their forest with a conveniently visible energy religion (Tron). Something meaningful is conveyed with the phrase ""I SEE you!"" (Joy Luck Club). In the end there is a war featuring man-shaped robot-exoskeletons (Mars Attacks, Transformers, Star Wars, Aliens, District 9, MIB, Robocop, Terminator). And a Latina Marine sacrifices herself (Aliens). What surprising about Avatar is how shamelessly derivative it is, while 20-year olds ignorant of older movies tell you it's the most original, most important thing since glow-in-the-dark bread. I hope to never see another movie with the exoskeleton idea again. Because 20 years later, films have thoroughly exhausted the concept. There is some good stuff in Avatar. Chief among it, is a subversive viewer-identity concept that has you rooting against your own species/planet. It's perfectly appropriate that Cameron sees through the Iraq war and the moral bankruptcy of both corporations and the Right; but he dares to say five thousand marines with tunnel-vision being led by a hot-head who's never created anything, are NOT the pride of the nation. And he's right. It's very strange to be delighted when the humans finally get decimated. A strange moment to witness... and it's brought to you by the growing revulsion people feel for a misused army and for evil corporations in general, and the sickening cross-pollination of the two.Two gigantic moral quandaries are never even addressed: Isn't it unethical to make living things that have no life until a person avatars them? And the marine is still selling out the natives waaaaaay after he's come to admire them ??? The movie is not really science fiction... it is fantasy, which is not really my cup of Q'thar. If you've seen one Native American documentary and two National Geographic specials, you've seen these ideas before. (Why do I keep buying the 3-D glasses? In every 3-D movie, the effect is interesting for exactly ten minutes.)"
"All I have to say is no amount of creative digital imagery can make up for the lack of overall good writing and/or acting in this film.For a film with serious messages, it was hard to take seriously with the cartoonish special effects. Giant smurfs with a vendetta against humanity taken straight from the Greenpeace movement don't particularly help with that particular political agenda.While I admired the good digital scenery effects, I think the characters needed a lot more production work before the film's final release. None of that could have made up for how ridiculous the character of Colonel Miles Quaritch was played out, or the emotionally unmoving aspects of the relationship between Jake Sully and Neytiri. In the end, I found myself rooting for the military as they chopped down the ""home tree"" and laughing as the giant smurfs sat around another tree, singing to invoke Jake Sully into his smurf body.The entire plot was extremely predictable. Interesting idea for a film, but an epic failure in following through with the concept for this audience member. The critics must have been paid a lot to let this one past their critical radar."
"Saw this in 3D today - has my thumbs up! The 3D works (even with my vision) and the story, although predictable (I'd figured out the ending by about 20 minutes into the film) was nonetheless very enjoyable and touched me deeply in several scenes.Actually, the film reminded me a lot of two SF stories: Call me Joe by Poul Anderson, and Hothouse by Brian Aldiss. Anyway, the themes are not new, but what is new is the totality of the treatment. Almost all of the action takes place in an alien environment with the Narvi - all of which is computer generated. There is live action footage and characters spliced into this as well, and it is absolutely seamless. Within 10 minutes I was immersed into the environment, and wishing it really existed!With a lot of films of this ilk the plot is a bit simplistic. We don't know much about the corporation exploiting the planet, but we can guess that this is either the same one seen in the Aliens films, or one very similar in operation. Really though the situation mirrors a number of colonial and post-colonial situations in recent history, where local and indigenous populations lost out to overseas interest in their resources.No doubt about who the ""bad guys"" are and this is pretty clear from the trailer. It takes time but you learn about the Narvi over the course of the film and come to understand their culture and religion - a religion that seems to be based on a ""real goddess"" as well. But it's also clear that ultimately the good guys will win, and that the main character will, well you'll see. Suffice it to say that what happens is telegraphed well before it occurs.But even with its predictability, I loved this film. I shall have to see it again, without the 3D,to see if that makes a difference."
"Finally Avatar has arrived.I was one of the thousands who bought tickets in advance to avoid disappointment.Yes the movie was great.Very nice story,excellent graphics and a nice message too.However,Avatar too has some not-so-nice-things to list.Cameron has largely depended on the technology used and graphics to make the movie work.In fact the story seems to be tailor-made to exploit the groundbreaking technology.But to me the graphics just seemed to be similar to other sci-fi movies such as star trek,star wars(revenge of the sith) and lotr.In fact i enjoyed Star Trek(2009) more because i went to star trek with no hype and JJ Abrams was no Cameron to build much hype.secondly for most parts the movie was just like a first-person-shooter game centering the lead avatar.The occasional zooming in effects reminded me games such as Crysis and Call-of-duty but the effects were nice.and the movie was mostly predictable with the good guys winning at the climax.The build up to the conflict and the hero's rise were all clichéd.Pandorra was definitely worth a visit and its spectacular lifeforms are mind-blowing but James Cameron definitely could have thought better for this 12 years wait.his earlier movies such as Titanic,Terminator 2 and alien were much much better.They were more engrossing,thrilling and original.Cameron could have jut a made a movie with real people i the real world.Doubt this movie can justify his portfolio.Apart from the bad thing Avatar definitely has its share of commendable stuff.As per most reviews the soundtrack of this movie was wonderful and i am going to watch this movie again just for that.But this time in 2d as found the 3d distracting.The emotional scenes between neytiri and jake sully's avatar were nice.James Cameron is a master in writing romantic scenes.Avatar is worth the watch but its just another sci-fi movie and its definitely not going to dethrone Titanic.Lets see how Tin Tin(Spielberg) and Inception(Christopher Nolan) fare in 2010"
"Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the most well-done CGI hand in hand with the most disappointed movie of the year - yes, put your hands together for Avatar.No, no - don't get me wrong. The movie's not bad. But the script is horribly weak! I don't know if this has anything to do with the fact that I was watching a dubbed version, but the dialogues were disappointing enough. Cameron has come up with the most convincing CGI production, but, I wonder why, he only relies on the CGI? Why didn't he work more on the story and, specially the script? The direction is very slow at times, and tends to get irritating. The predictability of the movie is the worst part. We're tired of the some-stroke-of-luck last- minute-life-saving moments of the lead roles. Let them DIE man!Go watch Avatar for the deliciously sweet eye-candy, but if you're hoping for something big, then you might as well skip it."
"Unfortunately Cameron looks down to the public and offers us a story so full of clichés and of a simplified view of the world, people and the Universe in general, that it is truly condescending. Neither he nor the studio behind him respect their audience. And after they sunk a reported 400 or so million in the project who can blame them? They need to recoup at least most of this money, and they do it by trying to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. I think Jim Schembri from The Age sums it up very well: ""There's no argument that, as a showcase for the immersive potential of 3D visual effects technology, James Cameron's sci-fi epic Avatar is an unqualified triumph. But as a story designed to engage, enthral and entertain adult audiences for almost three hours, it is a disappointment strewn with weak characters, environmental platitudes and anti-progress clichés. A compulsive envelope-pusher, Cameron invented a pioneering camera system and ground-breaking visual processing techniques for the film, but perhaps he should have spent a little less time obsessing over the technology and a tad more developing the story beyond the compendium of clichés it regrettably is."" My vote is 10 + 4/ 2 = 7."
"I hated Avatar.Those three words are more true than anything else I can think of right now. With one of the biggest film budgets in history, and with his first film since Titanic, James Cameron puts another big budget film back on the big screen.The visual effects were average, the characters VERY forgettable, the dialog atrocious, the plot very predictable, and the storyline was extremely unoriginal.Instead of something remotely original, Cameron took elements from Dances With Wolves, the animated films, Ferngully and Pocahontas, The Matrix, and his own Terminator films and combined them into one of the biggest messes ever put on the big screen.By the end of the film I cared absolutely nothing for any of the characters, the lead is about as dull as the bottom of my shoe, the idiotic ""blue monkeys"" were irritating, and the evil humans just got more laughable as time went on.The fact that so many people view this film as good film-making makes me question the intelligence of every person who does so. This isn't good film-making, it's just as bad directing as Michael Bay at his worst. I can guarantee you that if James Cameron's name wasn't attached to this awful film, it would have RAZZIE written all over it. In fact, I think the script and the direction should both get RAZZIE nominations, and I could care less what the fans of this ridiculous film think.Avatar is not only James Cameron's weakest film, it's also film-making for the lowest common denominator!"
"I don't want to bash this movie. Trust me, I don't. It truly hurts me more than anything that I have to call this movie nothing more than some of the most gorgeous CGI ever committed to film. They are really mesmerizing and absolutely stunning. The reason I gave this movie a 1/10 however is that visuals(no matter how transcendent in their nature), do not make a movie. They make part of a movie. For this reason the movie feels in my opinion to be rushed, as if they focused completely on the graphics over the story. So basically, this is what the Star Wars prequels would look like if done by James Cameron: All special effects, and very little story and character development. Frankly, Avatar is a very powerful disappointment, and I expect better from James Cameron, who is practically legendary in his skills as a filmmaker."
"Welcome to 21 century western style ...all is missing is a John Wayne avatar ... am so disappointed, oh YES, big time.CGA and 3-D effects are fabulous, like nothing one this world, but after 60 maybe 90 minutes, the magic is gone and the lack of original storyline is to conspicuous.I guest they were to much into the magics of new special effects and they just forgot to get at least a decent script. What is puzzled me is where in the woods they spend 400+ millions $, it's just beyond me, and I know software....! Probably,in the final bill they add the cleaning lady to with like 5000$/day! For 400mil.$ Cameron could almost fix a country like Haiti or East Timor and get a Nobel Price! What a waste of creative energy and money."
"At first I was in awe of this movie...the special effects are amazingly real looking. It was fascinating to see another world evolve before my eyes that was filled with fawn and fauna.Then I waited for the story to begin...and that's when the let-down began. The movie is a $250 Million dollar cowboy and Indians picture. The earth mining company (the cowboys) want to kick the planet's inhabitants out (the Indians) so they can rape and pillage the land (the New World). The political agenda was so clear...Americans (or Europeans) are bad and all the natives of the countries they colonized (even if it was for the better) are good. It would have been far better to camouflage this agenda a little so it would not seem like a lecture.I was hoping the ending would justify the rest of the movie...I was wrong there too...it was quite hard to believe that bows, arrows, and animals, would easily, and rather quickly, take down a gargantuan military force"
"Avatar was painfully unoriginal. Sure it looks good, but I've seen this same tired worn out story 40 times during my 47 years on this planet. It is too long -- it clock in at 2 1/2 ass-numbing hours-- too boring, and it takes itself way too seriously. Not to mention the fact that there are plot holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through. I would have thought that for $300 million Cameron could have bought an original story. Instead, Avatar offers the same old worn out themes that leftist Hollywood has been cranking out since the communist infiltration back in the late 1940s. The top three reasons why I go to see a movie are ENTERTAINMENT! ENTERTAINMENT!! ENTERTAINMENT!!! Unfortunately, despite all of it's pretty bells & whistles Avatar does not deliver."
"This movie has great special effects and a cool central sci-fi theme; the concept of an ""avatar."" 9 or 10 stars for each. But unfortunately the movie lacks any cohesive plot, has cookie-cutter characters and cliché dialog. This lack of originality destroys what should be emotionally charged moments and creates painfully stereotyped/racist portrayals. Also, the beauty of the digital animation is undermined by uninspired cinematography. So 10 stars for animation, but everything else was below average: 3 or 4 stars each for direction, writing, cinematography, plot, etc.Overall, this is a bad movie which contains one or two precious gems: the avatar concept is wonderful fantasy, and the images are stunning."
"What an incredible film! Cinematography of the a new era. Where do I start ? It seems that it's a just perfect sci-fi blockbuster that is at the same time a fairytale, a love story and a battle for survival. But it continues being a (delayed) cry for the slaughtered tribes that used to live in what is now called America or Australia, along with the deforestation and the irrational destruction of our natural environment. And last but not least, it is the 'connection' this all has with us.Watching Avatar springs into mind a perfect blending of elements and clichés of so many well known movies: Dancing with the Wolves, The Matrix, Born on the 4th of July and Pocahonta to name a few. But I found this to be superb! All in a future high-tech metaphora, of enormous weaponry and spaceships and a primitive jungle world that's both weird but also so familiar. Coming to the visual aspects of Avatar, I was simply awed. Its not the first Movie I've seen in 3D recently, but its certainly the best. I think that event if you remove 3D, this movie is an eye candy from start to finish. Simply amazing, but do watch it in 3D before it goes!"
"The visual effects in this movie are unseen and bombastic. After a wile you loose this feeling of ""it is just a movie"". You are immersed in the movie and you are exploring a new world. It is more than one time that you loose your breath. Beautiful images are following each other at high speed and you just can't believe what you are seeing.The story is a bit thin and predictable though there are nice character developments. But that just doesn't matter because Avatar is just more than a movie, more than a true masterpiece, it is a lifetime experience, a movie that writes film history.You have too see it in 3D, better IMAX, because the 3D images are a vital part of the movie and it is the way James Cameron intended it."
"I rated this movie 3 out of 10. But it deserves at least an 8. I just wanted to protest. A nice movie, a good movie indeed. Very rugged. Flowing. I'm not being sardonic, I really liked it. But its simple, even naive. Simple characters, simple story. One less dimension in the movie, an extra dimension in script won't hurt anybody. A great opportunity wasted I guess. Many talented people, worked hard for many years. So I wanted some depth. I expected something more than a 3D action thriller. Dancing with wolves did have something fresh, something nice. Discrict 9 has xenophobia, racism, bureaucracy, cold corporate mind, and action, friendship, delicious aliens, effects and some gore. It was fresh and surprising and new. Avatar is just big, simple, nice.I love American S.F. writers. Greg Bear, Theodore Sturgeon, and many more wrote books full of hive minds, planet sized intellects, and with some solid (fictional) science background too. Hall Clement's creatures, P.K.Dicks twisted visions, U.K.le Guin's poetic depth, they are truly amazing. SF opens ones mind. Good SF is also good philosophy, good literature, and it is always good for me. They are hundreds of amazingly disturbing, mind boggling, incredible books out there, but no one dares to touch them. I guess they are too complicated. Ot they prefer not to ruin them, yet.The story is, an evil, extortionist, capitalist, militarist world company decides to rape a magical planet with good scenery, full of half naked, very long legged girls, (all of them happen to love long walks in the woods, and on the woods, paragliding and horseback riding). But handful of humans seeing the error of their ways decides to lead them to an all out war against invasion. Their strategy consist of throwing things and ramming if possible, shrieking when all else fails. Not very Clausewitzian, and it does not work. But this planet has a hive mind, an alien Gaia, (which has perverse vision of evolution, very fond of feathers and lights, has a touch screen planet-wide, with built in internet). I don't know why but I can picture Mrs. Eywa knitting very bright colored sweaters. When Gaia intervenes it does not intervene gracefully or subtly. Great number of assorted colors of claws, jaws and horns settle the score. Ecological message, ""do not bomb the mother nature, she bites""Political message ""our foreign policy won't change soon"" Mineralogical message ""unobtainium does grow on trees"" Military message ""use ballistic missiles, drop something from orbit, do not catch arrows""Possible Na'vi extinction cause ""headache, tailache and combinations""Conclusion ""If your new bride is blue, just borrow some unobtainium""."
"In some ways this movie is trying to be an adult version of Ferngully the last rainforest. The part of the world inhabited by these creatures, the 'moldy h icans' is like a director's wet dream of Eden, only with attractively plant draped mountains that float (instead of bolting into space). Meanwhile the inhabitants are a wide range of large or stretched versions of creatures we are familiar with: Big big bugs or flying reptiles.It is a concept flick- man through technology transmits mind into fabricated creature that can live among the intelligent kind of its homeworld. The homeworld has something we (evil humans) want. Humans cannot live on planet but we want a precious material which defies gravity, baldly called unobtainium. The aliens are blue, and look (pick one) like elongated supermodels (every one of them) or cat people with no fur or whiskers. Either way you get wide faces and big yellow eyes right off those 70s paintings on black velvet only with pouty lips. One possibly somewhat original idea is that the intelligent social aliens have tails, at the end of which are exposed nerve fibers that can bond with significantly useful critters to ride, such as a reptilian eyed large flyer, or other critters where the nerve endings might come from other parts of their bodies like a tail to head mind-meld.I do not recall any of these sharp toothed creatures eating or any significant blood flow from anything. Even the roots of the trees are nerve endings according to the Sigourney Weaver character. Meanwhile, there are no latrines, these natives apparently wander around the vertical environment making nerve contact with wondrous beings but don't need to eat, defecate, raise children, set broken bones, sign contracts, clear leafmold, or establish a government. They don't apparently make music unless they are all arrayed in a large pattern helping the roots save someone's life or convert them to alienhood. It's like woodstock without the rain, the mud, or for that matter, the music. The movie soundtrack was by James Horner who seemed to channel tangerine dream at times, and John Williams at other times. So sometimes the music was spacy, and other times it was star wars.It goes on for 2 and a half hours and is excruciatingly unbelievable on its own terms. More than the ten bucks, it's the 2 and a half hours I'll never get back and the pained look I could feel on my face as the bad guys were made to look really bad, driving bulldozers ten stories high or trying to destroy an especially important part of the fiber tree of life.If you loved the self-righteous extermination of the environment to make a point such as ""On Dangerous Ground"" where the good guys blow up an arctic oil refinery in order to promote environmentalism, this film may resonate with you.Personally, I think putting the ten dollars to a meal with a lot of fiber in it would have had more agreeable results with a better end product."
"Avatar is a lame fairy tale, boring and cringe-worthy, that will appeal only to those who are gullible and easily taken in by an attempt to be fantastical. I love movies and sadly, this one not only bored me to tears but sitting through it was sheer torture, nothing less. And this from James Cameron, whose Terminator and Titanic are my two favorite movies of all time and whose many other films i have seen, loved and admired. The great Sigourney Weaver, who is a class act, delivers a serviceable performance at most. Sam Worthington fares better, although one wishes at times that he had a little more of the charisma of a Leo DiCaprio or a Johnny Depp. Then there is the villain Col Quaritch who is so cartoonish he might have come straight from the pages of a comic book. The biggest tragedy of Avatar is that after all the years and money invested, the final product is so insipid, unoriginal and uninspiring. The music score doesn't come anywhere near John Barry's Dances With Wolves or James Horner's Titanic. And what is most scary is when Hollywood starts making crap movies like this, there is no hope left for mankind."
"So here goes another ""action thriller"" movie which is like any other run-of-the-mill variety except for its 3D sauce.A far-away planet inhabited by humanoids, who speak (accented English!!), act, walk, emote just like humans on earth, and whose land is rich in some mineral deposits - well the concept of ""pandora"" may be fine, its cinematography, or should I say rendering is awe-inspiring, use of 3D is innate and hence is simply mesmerizing, but without any story and character it is pure techno-porn.A battle sequence that is spiced up with motion-controlled robots and fancy looking warships controlled by eye-candy projector screens, deserves a better climax than a knife and bow-arrow fight between the main characters, particularly so when the ""winner"" is a no-brainer! Even as a 3D spectacle like ""never-before-seen"", at ~ 3 hours, even my eyes start feeling the weight of those goggles. To conclude, in my opinion, this is a movie about ""How to win the love of a humanoid chick in less than 100 days"" - (if you notice carefully, Jake's last video log is numbered 98!) No wonder it drags for so long..."
"I felt pretty embarrassed while watching this movie, like more than when I went to see Twilight or Harry Potter. The characters have African accents and features, fake native American ''culture'' including feather head-dresses and using every part of the animal, blue smurf skin and ride around on pterodactyls like Everquest. And they do drum dances to worship a tree god. like, an actual tree that is their god. literally. not as a metaphor, and not a talking tree, just a plain old burnable wooden tree that is also their god.We are clearly meant to take all this seriously, which is the really sad part: the audience was literally laughing out loud. I mean...I've written some stuff I'd be severely embarrassed to have other people read, and then other people read it, so I can relate to the writer here. I feel bad for him. but STILL.Everyone keeps saying in the other reviews how much money is involved as if that makes the movie good when to my view it makes the whole situation even more embarrassing. There is no way i could have overestimated this movie's moronicness before seeing it, yet we've mobilized massive amounts of our modern cultural capital squarely behind something that reads like everquest fanfic. I'm a little bit frightened by all the positive reviews---I'm afraid people are going to spot me and say ''you're not one of us'' and either give me a lobotomy or try to eat me.My favorite character was definitely the corporate overlord. He refers to what they seek as ''unobtainium'' which is an old Usenet/scifi word, and I chuckled because his character was so clued-in and terse in his evilness, made it fun. but then later in the movie he shouts in a serious high-action moment ''the unobtainium is underneath that rock right there!'' and then military dudes fire on the rock, or something, as if the corporate guy doesn't realize it's not actually called unobtainium. That's just a snarky stand-in word for when you're explaining a common story to someone else and want to say ''who cares what it really is,'' when of course it _is_ something specific when you're outside a moment of reflexive exposition. It's like the writer heard some clued people talking to each other, didn't really get what they were talking about but decided he wanted to be just like them, then tried to mimic them. like when a five year old tries to swear like a drunken sailor but doesn't know how to use the words right yet so he sounds all FOB-y, the movie was like that.also like i said, they have blue skin, talk like continental Africans, and ride around on pterodactyls. please don't forget that part. If you think you can handle this, whatever, go for it."
"This was a lousy decade for sci-fi films and I think the 00s have claimed James Cameron, the one person I was counting on to bring back the glory days of the 80s and 90s. What happened to all the Aliens, the Terminators, the RoboCops, the Abysses, the Predators, the Total Recalls, the Jurassic Parks, even The Running Mans? Muscular sci-fi action movies that wowed us with fantastic concepts and visuals while commenting on poignant truths with wit and lack of pretense?For all those triumphs, James Cameron is my personal film-making hero. Which makes the following all the harder to say: AVATAR is Cameron's weakest film to date. Which isn't to say that it's bad... but it's bad for a James Cameron movie.First, the story is unoriginal. It's ""Pocahontas"", plain and simple. The Na'vi, despite being blue and 10 feet tall, are your typical chanting, dancing, Mohawk-sporting, bow-shooting, bead-wearing, body-paint-covered, ""Earth-is-our-mother"" whooping Indians.Just pop in a DVD of the 1995 Disney cartoon and count the similarities: Intrepid male soldier who sets off to a new world in search of danger & adventure to test himself? Check. Equally adventurous daughter of the natives' Chief that secretly spies the white soldier exploring her land, befriends him and teaches him the ways of the tribe? Check. The stiff Chief-to-be appointed suitor that the native princess shuns in favor of the white guy? Check. The ensuing fight between the two and arranged execution of the white guy? Check. The white visitors' authority who only cares about money and guns, calling the natives ""savages"" and launching a final confrontation under false pretenses? Check. The native princess leading the white guy to a sacred tree to ask for advice? Check. The way she then defends the white soldier from her own people as they are about to kill him? Check. Christ, I'm surprised Neytiri didn't break out into song about teaching Jake how to paint with ""the colors of the wind"".From what I read, Cameron first wrote this story in 1995, the year the Pocahontas movie came out. Coincidence? Either way, I've seen it all before.Second, why were the characters so under-developed? Jake and Neytiri's romance feels, at points, shoehorned to forward the plot. Their first meeting: ""Why didn't you let me die?"" ""Because you have a strong heart."" Come on, Jim, I know you can do better than that. The point at which they confess their love essentially boils down to ""I choose you"" ""I choose you too"" with none of the crafted buildup that led to Jack & Rose's first kiss on the Titanic.Trudy Chacon. What is her motivation? Why is she helping our heroes? Why is she the ONLY pilot who suddenly (and awkwardly) says ""f*** it"" and turns away from blasting the Na'vi tree? Does she have friends, insecurities, family? She's just a chick there to quip lines and kick ass.The bad guys are painfully one-dimensional. Quatrich is a maniac without an ounce of humanity. Think Lieutenant Coffey from ""The Abyss"", except without the gradual slide into madness from the anger and paranoia. Coffey cried tears before setting off the nuke and that's when you realize the guy is gone... you almost feel sorry for the man before he implodes in his crippled craft. By contrast, Quatrich is a G.I. Joe that likes to blow stuff up for the fun of it. Selfridge is equally limp: just a cardboard cutout of some tie-wearing yuppie who only cares about the bottom line. Do these guys have friends? Ideals? Outside lives? Nope, they're just there as straw men in this transparent social commentary.Which brings me to: ""War on Terror"", ""pre-emptive strike"", ""shock and awe"". These are words thrown out by the baddies at the finale without anyone so much as blushing, just in case there was any doubt what half the movie's commentary is about. I'm about as anti-Bush and anti-IraqWar as you can get, and these bald-faced references made me cringe. Gone is any masterful subtlety that allows the audience to piece together their own conclusions -- let's simply hammer it into their heads instead. Even Dubya himself was less simplistic than the caricatures portrayed in this movie and this kind of straw-man commentary actually works contrary to the aims of the artist because it paints a picture of someone too evil, too simple, and too unidentifiable to be compared to any kind of actual person, thus letting the real villain off the hook.I know Cameron is a better writer than this, which is what surprised and frustrated me most of all. So what happened in those 12 years? Maybe the epic battle scenes of the new ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" movies gave him the foolish idea that anyone possibly empathizes with hundreds of faceless pawns getting shot and killed in massive battle scenes while our hero soldier and his beloved warrior princess emerge alive and victorious. Maybe he felt that ""District 9"", ""Iron Man"" and ""Transformers"" didn't amply satisfy our lust for cool CGI battle-bots sequences. Maybe his extended absence has let lesser visionaries like Peter Jackson and Michael Bay set the course for epic adventure cinema and he was merely following suit.The movie is visually stunning and another landmark achievement in effects. But the same can be said for Star Wars Episodes I - III and I don't see anyone hailing those movies as masterpieces. All in all, with AVATAR, Cameron has again become a pioneer of visual effects... but the complete opposite is true in terms of writing. He has fallen to regurgitating the tired sci-fiction/fantasy plots and concepts of this lackluster decade, forgot how to craft an organic plot and love story, and neglected to hide the marionette strings in his bold social commentary puppet show.You're still my hero, Jim. I look forward to ""Battle Angel"" with, for the first time, cautioned optimism."
"The first thought in my head was: Are you kidding me?! The story is old and well known, predictable and childish. The technology surely is something new but I've got some simple questions: 1.Is it so hard when you make a nice technology to finish the deal with a nice plot?!?!?!(after all some really brilliant movies are in war for the audience attention and they are being judged for so many things other than effects...) 2.Are we supposed to like those ugly bluish creatures just because they seem real?! 3. Rally?No kidding? U actually believe that a naive predictable cliché story should be called ""the best movie"" even though its just ridiculous: blue creatures on another planet telling us the story of Pocahontas....seriously I feel abused...."
"Yes, I totally agree with jerichocane-1, Avatar is a remake of Dances with Wolves, but with blue and very tall Indians.Moreover, there is question in the IMDb FEQ section that says, and I quote:""Is ""Avatar"" based on a book?No. Avatar is based on an original screenplay penned by writer/director/producer James Cameron"".That is not exactly true. Many years ago, in a book of the ""The Science Fiction Hall of Fame edited by Ben Bova, I read a story about a crippled man on a wheel chair, mentally connected to a super-being (a feline centaur in this case) who was intended to establish a colony in a very aggressive planet, unfit for human settlers. At the end, the man abandons his wasted human form to live a new, challenging life in the planet. Sounds familiar?Unfortunately, I remember neither the title nor the name of the writer.I concede that Avatar has a good creative work regarding the environment in Pandora, but the script is a bad mixture of good old stories.By the way, wasn't there also a pirate called Cameron?P.S. Well, I finally found the story. It is Poul Anderson's ""Call me Joe"", written in 1957.Please check the link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_JoeAnd I accept that some mediocre script writers find ""inspiration"" in other people writings, but at least they should have the decency of giving the credit."
"James Fenimore Cooper meets the 21st century. The Noble Savage theme just will not die. Here, it gets recycled into the ""covert operative infiltrates enemy camp and finds out they are nobler than us and changes sides, with tragic consequences"" plot line. Moreover, the bad guys are cartoonishly bad and the good guys are utterly without fault, cartoonishly noble. A good movie is one that tells us something true and challenges our understanding of ourselves, our world, our values. In this film, none of the characters has any genuine depth or is even remotely believable. While this may be OK in a mindless action movie, for a film that pretends to be ""important"", such failings are not forgivable. The one original part of the movie is the avatar concept. The rest is overdone, anti-Western, neo-pagan claptrap, albeit with genuinely impressive special effects. Somebody out there really knows what to do with a computer."
"I was very moved by this film. I saw it as an allegory of what the whites did to the natives in North America, South America, Australia, New Zea land and Tasmania (especially there)--almost complete genocide for the sake of monetary profit by corporate magnates. And since corporations are the real power in developed countries: they have carte blanche to kill as needed. They usually are clever in creating a body of lies that help to dehumanize the victims. (Easier to kill 'em).The way to drive such a principle home, which means into the heart AND the head, is to show both sides. So we see the natives, Navi, in their culture which includes art, mythology, dance, music, and meaningful rituals. You can come to love any culture (even white European) if you are exposed to this side of humans. And in so doing, it would become horrible to wipe them out for the sake of a fat bank account back home. That is what Cameron does. He gets you on the side of the humanity, in this case, the Navi. (We already know about the dark side of homo Sapiens but it is well sketched in here by the mercenary grunts. I think DANCES WITH WOLVES tells much the same story. There the corporate element stays in the background which was OK for that film.I was like a little boy visiting a heaven-like world with ""people"" who were conscious of other things besides money and power. In the back of my mind I wondered that any race could be that harmonious. North American ""Indians"" treated other tribes horribly in most areas like on the the Plains and conducted raids and wars where there was much cruelty. (See the film THE BLACK ROBE, for a New England version of this.) Were the Navi like that? And what if they were? I guess the question is greed. Given the means would some Navi have exterminated other tribes and gotten rich? They didn't seem to need to be rich.So are all intelligent bipedal creatures alike? I once heard a theory about why there are no space travelers from beyond--if they became as intelligent as we, they'd also encounter the same jealousies and greed that we have, thus preventing them from combining their resources and cooperating--the infighting would bar them from space travel.A wonderful epic film. The love story was poetic. The creatures were beautiful and scary. So were the plants. The hero started off a klutz but grew on me. And I liked hearing Wes Studi's voice again. He was the ""bad"" Indian in DANCES as he was in LAST OF THE MAHICANS."
"oh my god, i have seen a lot of movies, although there are still a few movies i like more than avatar, but i give avatar a perfect 10/10, and i've never given any movie a perfect score. Avatar deserve a special spot on its own, in that it is not just a movie, it's an experience, watch it in 3d and imax if you can, because you almost feel like you are there. YOU HAVE TO GO SEE IT. PERIOD. It made me depressed afterwards that i have to go back to the normal, boring life again. oh, how much i would give to live in pandora! I also like the romance in the movie, that got me kind of emotional.ps: don't wait for the DVD, don't watch it on the computer or TV, don't see it in 2d, or even 3d, but see it in IMAX 3D, and i promise you will not regret it."
"OK, this is my first review but i am going to be completely honest.First of all, this movie is predictable. A handicapped marine was given a mission to get close to the clans, eventually fall in love with one of them, then became one of them. Its so predictable it took of all the excitement i had throughout the whole movie! I though it would be a great plot since the budget of this movie was so expensive, so i kept my hopes high. In the end, it ends up just as mentioned. Disappointed...Secondly, the CGIs. This can actually be an animation since almost every scene is completely in CGI. And the CGI even looked cartoon-ish. The characters looked cartoon-ish,the creatures looks cartoon-ish. The only thing I enjoyed in this movie is the scenery. (Hence the 3, it would be a 2 if it wasn't for the scenery.) It's not a bad movie actually,it's watchable. I just think with the given budget it could be just a lot better,a way lot better movie than this."
"Avatar as a visual exercise is a masterpiece,however that should not distract from the terrible dialogue and boring storyline.It is an overlong and dreary rehash of a story that has been done before. The only character I could relate to was colonel Quaritch,about halfway through this funeral of a film I was hoping he'd succeed in slaughtering the blue shits and end the film. Unfortunately Its a Disney money making piece of sh-it, with hundreds of millions spent on marketing to convince the unwashed masses to put down their cheese burgers and turn off the X-factor/American idol.So the ""good guys"" have to win and colonel Quaritch dies(*sob*) before he can kill the human traitors and save the world. Only see this if you HAVE never seen 3D,other then that its a waste of time."
"Avatar is without a doubt the worst ripoff-remake ever ,i can't believe that no one else has notice, so what do we have here?, OK let's see, the space travel, the remote unexplored world, the hibernation, the hostile extraterrestrials, the marines, the robot suits, Sigourney Weaver!!!! come on!!!! it sounds familiar to you? ....sure it is familiar, it sounds like....Aliens(1986) from James Cameron. Mr Cameron committed plagiarism but not only with his own work, the script about a soldier who betrayed his own people has nothing of new or original, it is the same premise that The last Samurai (2003) from Edward Zwick, or dances with wolves (1990) from Kevin Costner, so what's new here? only the visual effects that are in fact state of the art....Cameron let us debt after all these years since Titanic, he has no new ideas, only better special effects"
"Okay first off I know a lot of people love this movie and they're going to hate me for this review but its the truth that a lot of you just need to understand...Avatar was NOT very creative in any way whatsoever. Let me list the issues:A story that reminds me of Disney's Pocahontas too much. If you want to make a good movie, make the story better. If it takes you 15 years to make this thing then you need to get it right. The story needs to be much more original than that. It needs far more development and they should have more information in it for a 2.5 hour movie.Special effects that weren't actually very good, they could have done better when they spent that much money on them... The ""big battle scene"" at the end wasn't very big really... It had lots of explosives yes, but thats about all.The acting wasn't 5 star in any way. There were some pretty cheesy lines too. Why do we need this nonsense? If its going to be the movie we'll remember then great... But I'm not going to remember this thanks to its lack of creativity. Inception beats it, times ten.3D? Meh, overrated. Okay so 3D gets really old; I saw How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar in it. You don't even notice it after 10 minutes into the movie! 3D is overrated and definitely overpriced."
"Avatar is a good movie, it's not ""awesome"" or ""unique"", and it's not even by chance ""the best movie ever made"" (god no). For start, I don't find the CGI or animation being important in any movie, I found the plot, OST and characters being the most important part of a movie; in those aspects:The movie had a good (but not remarkable) OST, it's good, but after 3 hours becomes tedious.The plot was good also and I liked how they represented colonialism, but did you noticed that Jake NEVER speaks to the Na'vi about the unobtainium and why they were invading them? THAT WAS YOU PRIMARY ORDER DUDE!. It also had nothing new or ""revolutionary"" like all the critics were saying for some reason, it's just another random Hollywood plot which looks like if it was promoted by Greenpeace.About the characters, the only good thing I found is how the Na'vi were made, they're very convincing for me, but that was the only good part. I hated the rest of the characters, about Neytiri, the movie ended and I couldn't remember her name, I think they mentioned it like 3 times in the whole movie (she was a MAIN character) and she was like a bad-ass 16 teenager or something alike that doesn't seem right for a love nature princess; the ""evil"" guy had no brain at all, one would think that in a future where they can create giant-blue-people-clones, they would have some kind of mental standard to choose a general who will lead an army in the space, but no. And all the ""original"" creatures that Camron created, they seemed like a big ""Final Fantasy X"" plagiarism, really, FFX has a tribe of savage-blue-giant people, has an Eidolon called Ixion who is identical to the Na'vi's horses, has dragons which seems a lot like those in the film, and has flying light balls of energy like those ""jellyfish"".So in conclusion, if I had to choose between watching Avatar again or playing Final Fantasy X, I would stay home and play FFX, is practically the same with a better plot and more interaction."
"I'll start by saying that Avatar is a great action movie. James Cameron served notice to George Lucas and ILM that they aren't the major players in the Sci-Fi film making anymore. The action in this movie puts the Star Wars franchise to shame with the exception of The Empire Strikes Back. The final 40 minutes are a 3D CGI tour-De-force of breath-taking battles, explosions and war machines that will leave your jaw swinging in the breeze! ""So much for the prince, now about the monster.""- Suetonius, The Twelve Ceasars, in reference to Caligula.Ever wonder what would happen if you put the cartoon: ""Smurfs"", script elements of the Space Marines from ""Aliens"", the Broadway play, ""Cats"", Richard Dreyfus's character from ""Whose Life Is It Anyway"", and the hollow tree from the Keebler cookie commercials, and tossed the lot into a blender? Well, you would get ""Avatar""! This is probably the most half-assed, lazy script in Sci-Fi I have seen; clichéd and over wrought with cardboard characters, a five year old on cough syrup could have written better. Let's delve into why, shall we? Poor Jake Sully! He's a paraplegic who has lived in the shadow of his more talented brother; a scientist in a military operation that gets killed in a robbery. The military perceives Jake as a F___up, irresponsible, childish, not military material, unlike his more popular, deceased brother. So for whatever reason(I know; he's gonna use the money to buy legs) the military decides to place him in the Avatar project his brother worked on. WHY? No one believes he can do anything productive in it, even head scientist Augustine thinks he's unsuitable initially. Jake Sully is depressed and trying to find a place in a world that doesn't need a cripple. (Whose Life Is It Anyway?!) At this point forward, things get stupid and kooky.See, the Earth needs a mineral called ""Unobtanaium"" that will save humanity from some misfortune; the point is laid out out by a greedy lil' executive lifted directly from the ""Aliens"" script. And the only place to get it is from Pandora, and its sentient race, the Na'vi(Smurfs, 10 ft tall ones with prehensile tails)don't know where its located. Cameron probably gave the script to one of his children at this time because the idiocy just piles up like a stack of pancakes. You see, if your planet needs some valuable mineral to save humanity, the last thing you do is put Gomer Pyle on your team, and while objections abound toward allowing Sully on board, no one in a MILITARY OPERATION stops him. My temples were throbbing at this point. They'll explode later! Everything else, you see coming from a country mile! Sully digs getting to walk with his new avatar body and proceeds to screw the project up. He isn't supposed to get too cozy with the Na'vi, yet does anyway. Falls in love, etc. But, of course! He doesn't fit in with the humans in the program; he is rolling in the fantasy of being something that he isn't. We know it won't take long for him to fall in love with his new body- he's a paraplegic. It's an obvious plot point. That's what I mean by Cameron's script being a heap of laziness. He doesn't even try to be creative, just derivative. He robs his movies and other works and hammers them together even though they don't mesh, and he doesn't care if you notice.The vistas are ripped off from old YES album covers(artist Roger Dean), Sully has a fall from grace after falling for Neytiri, daughter of the clan chief. Natch- its always a princess! The head of the project is an crusty, hard core Marine who only wants to wipe the Na'vi out because they are in the way of his mission. You know he's going to try to decimate them after he talks for 2 minutes. The Na'vi have been compared to the Smurfs, but they are more like an off-Broadway production of Cats; look closely. There's even a mythical beast that only Sully can tame, which he uses on the Marines. Of course! Then, there's Hometree(Keebler elves and their hollow magical tree). So, all the unobtanium is conveniently located under the most sacred thing in the Na'vi's lives- how effing obvious! On the whole of Pandora, there is just one Hometree, but the Na'vi are spread like peanut butter across the planet- WHY? And why is a mineral only under a tree, and one tree at that? I do remember my HS geology, shouldn't old plant material be like oil? The Na'vi have no idea that its the mineral the humans are after, why not just mine it out from under them? Guess because we would be deprived of some excellent action at the near end of the movie. It's like ""Titanic"", really. You revel in the carnage as the Na'vi's tree is toppled. And of course, our hero gets to keep his new body and live happily ever after.This is a bubble gum movie, nothing more. It has no real depth, no honesty, no meaning; save that war is the answer to a mineral shortage. But the make believe world is awesome; maybe thats enough to redeem it. But to be honest, I can't sit through another viewing of the thing. It makes your mind go numb. Do yourself a favor, watch ""The Terminator"", or ""Aliens"" again. This movie will go stale on you fast!"
"I was very impressed with the effects. They were wonderful. Ultimately, however, the storyline was utterly predictable. The emotions shown were overly maudlin and the characters were two dimensional. Were it not for the special effects, after the first 20 minutes one would be better off simply imagining the rest. While it has been claimed that the movie's message is ""anti-business"", it is really another rehashing of the ""Noble Primitive"" tale, an idea which Hollywood has done to death. It seems somehow ironic that it was done using millions of dollars with cutting edge technology to create a futuristic science fiction movie. Or, if its message really is a warning against the evils of big business, it certainly has made a lot of money. I give it 5 stars for the special effects, because they almost make it worth watching."
"If I described the plot of this to someone who had no idea that the movie had crazy special effects, they'd say that it sounds predictable. Well it is. It has one of the worst villains I've ever seen in a movie and every plot point is cliché and uninspired. Although if the movie had ended with the tree being destroyed and the Navi losing, I would've loved it. The Navi paralleled American Indians until the ended when they won, which ruined the whole point of making them reminiscent of Indians. If they had committed to that and given it a sad ending, the movie would've actually had a message instead of characters just constantly saying that ""we destroyed our earth"" and stuff like that. And the only the movie is the highest grossing movie ever is because it's in 3d, which adds $3 to every ticket sold."
"People can spout how wonderful James Cameron's genius is when it comes to making huge, expensive and successful films, that isn't too hard to debate. But to say this film is original in any way is a bit of a stretch. Anyone who has watched Star Trek, Farscape, StarGate, and other sci fi films and series know that the storyline is NOT new. Granted, the special effects have come a long way from years ago and it shows in how much money and time he has put into the film. What I have to love is the fact that for all the hype and speculation for Academy nominations, everyone EXPECTED AVATAR to win. . .and it didn't. His first ex-wife won with her film about a real life subject and way under a fraction of the amount Cameron spent. The Gods have a good sense of humor to be sure. :-)"
"Yes this is 'Science Fiction', but the intended relationships with the elements of reality were so poor that they grated on my nerves throughout. Very clever CGI. Lovely colours. Sexy aliens. Characters absolutely unsympathetic. I couldn't develop any empathy at all with who they were or what they were doing. Any of them.The military staff were portrayed as the worst kind of gung-ho 'shoot-em- ups', full of prejudice against the natives of the land they have invaded so that they can steal the resources. The director couldn't have been less subtle in taking a swipe at Americans and America's foreign policies. Unintelligent. Was the film intended for an audience so self-centred and insulated from the world that the message needed to be force-fed at the expense of the final quality of the film?"
"There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. I know it's been months since the release but I have to get this off my chest. To refresh my memories I fast-forwarded the movie in HD and... what an overrated piece of crap. The negative reviews are right - exclude the CGI and you're left with nothing. On the same note the CGI is not even that great. They've spent $500 million on this but guess what, the CG characters still look fake. Hell even the real ones look fake. I've seen more believable CG characters: I Robot, District 9, Watchmen, King Kong... Anyways, let me try to break this down: 1. First of all let's take a look at the story. We all know what it is so I'm not going to summarize it. Cameron had 13 years and half a billion dollars at his disposal and yet he FAILED to come up with a decent plot. The story is cheap, predictable, the script is full of clichés of all kinds and it's copied from a bunch of other sources. It's so banal it's not even worth telling your kids as a bedtime story. You're probably thinking ""this guy has the nerve to use the word 'story'...?"". I admit that IS wrong.2. Characters. Let's face it, every character in this movie is the very definition of the word stereotype. You've got this slow marine, some geeky scientists, a tough woman lead scientist, a greedy corporate guy, a bad-ass military guy, a fragile forbidden female for the marine to fall for, her father he has to impress... Anything you can think of that isn't original - you've got it here. This literally forces you to not care about any of them throughout the whole movie. I know what you're thinking, you're thinking ""this guy has the nerve to use the word 'character'...?"".3. Jake Sully is the main character. Cameron knew his movie was going to suck, so he made the main character double crippled in an attempt to make you care about him. Jake Sully is a slow paraplegic ex-marine. Every sentence he comes up with sounds as if written by a 5 year old. The following scene literally proves my point. OK, so Neytiri, the beautiful and fragile aborigine girl saves Jake from the dangers of the forest and takes him to her tribe, the elders gather and mumble about something, Jake asks ""what are they talking about"", Neytiri says ""my father is deciding whether to kill you"". If it were you you'd probably go ""oh shoot, they want to kill me, what do I do"". But not Jake, he's smarter than that, he's thinking with his dong. What Jake does, he stretches out his hand and says ""oh you're the father, nice to meet you sir"". You're surrounded by a tribe of savage aliens that openly want to kill you, they don't speak a word of English and this is the best you can come up with to protect your skin? What a retard!4. Music really sucks. All that new world / ethnic crap... come on!5. The whole concept of Pandora is ridiculous to say the least. Remember, this is a moon some 6 light years away from Earth, and yet everything is the same. Humans biologically have more things in common with the Naaaaviiii from 6 light years away than with any other creature on Earth. Genius!5.1. Pandora is a moon and from the shots Cameron shows us we see that the planet it's orbiting is actually very big. The events take place during quite a long period of time and yet we never see a solar eclipse. Makes you wonder how the hell is Pandora orbiting it's planet so that these people over a period of a few years never witness a simple solar eclipse. I'll tell you why it never happens in the movie. If an eclipse took place on Pandora, even if it were for just a few days, no creature would possibly survive on that piece of rock. Cameron couldn't have that in the movie without backing it up with some more sci-fi stuff, but you can't really blame the guy, he had only 13 years to think this through! 5.2. Everything is the same. The creatures, the primate Naaavii, vegetation, landscape, waterfalls, sky etc. Humans can't survive on Pandora without an oxygen mask, meaning the atmosphere has to consist of something else, doesn't this also mean that the sky has to have a different color? Too complicated for the average moviegoer?5.3. At some point in the movie the oh so bad-ass colonel Quaritch says the low gravity can make your muscles soft, that's why he goes to the gym. And yet, as they move around, as Ribisi is playing golf, you never actually see motion being affected by low gravity. Remember the moon landing footage? See what I mean? Too complicated?5.4. My final point - Pandora is 6 freaking light years away! Cameron had every opportunity to make it look different, unusual, interesting and awesome. But he didn't. Instead he made it look exactly like Earth. Pandora might as well be some remote place here on Earth.What a waste of time, at least I'm glad I didn't pay to see this crap. Awful movies are being made all the time, what sickens me is the positive ratings Avatar is getting and all the facts surrounding it, the budget for one. Wouldn't it be more rewarding, for example, to instead feed and clothe the poor with that money. No, let's instead fill our minds with banal garbage. Avatar makes me feel political, and I am never political and I hate this movie for it."
"So I was watching the movie because of all the rave reviews about it, and man was i in for quite an unpleasant surprise. After the first 15 min my mind started to daydream about going to see a better movie to watch...then went further into the movie, contemplated watching wolfman and started imagining myself watching it. Then it came to all the action scenes or whatever and i just didn't feel the blue skin people thing. It was soooooooo unreal and just didn't capture my attention it reminded me of an intermediate computer project on film. I could not wait to get the hell out of there watching or trying to watch this crap of film..."
"How does James Cameron do it? How does he manage to take a hokey, transparent story and make it work? It is amazing. Just like with Titanic, Mr. Cameron creates a great movie out of an old story. The movie is great because it grabs and keeps the audience's interest. Also, Mr. Cameron takes CGI to a new level of sophistication, so much so that soon the CGI and the real acting merge as one ... and it works! Having expected this movie to be little more than a long cartoon, surprisingly the movie is a work of cinematic art, and not just an animated feature with voice overs added. The cast is superb, especially Stephen Lang, who plays perhaps the most challenging role, and the always lovely Michelle Rodriguez who gives a strong performance as a soldier with a heart. If this movie proves anything, it is that Michelle Rodriguez is one of the finest actors in Hollywood today, and beautiful too."
"The message behind Avatar is a noble one, but that doesn't go far enough to cover up the unimaginative storyline and dialogue. Avatar is heavy on clichés that we've seen plenty of times before: Hero goes to a strange land and isn't accepted by the natives. Fast forward 45 minutes and he's finally been accepted into their inner circle. Inevitably he will find someone there that he falls in love with at first sight. Their love will be endangered by the enemy that seeks to harm the natives in some way or other. And so on and so on. You can pretty much predict everything that's going to happen within the first 20 minutes, which is remarkable considering the running time is well past 2 and half hours.I give it a 5/10 based solely on it's visual merits and recognition for the amount of effort it takes to put something on this large of a scale together. That in itself is admirable. I just wish that there was actually some substance to back the film up."
"I will do an experiment review now: I will try to compare this movie to a woman.You catch a glimpse of her and you fall in love. You approach her, she gets prettier with every step you take towards her. Her smile blinds you and her eyes captivate you. You're drowning in her, deeper and deeper. Then you start a conversation with her, try to get to know her better. You notice that she talks simple, sometimes to the point of being unwise. The topics she chooses are boring and shallow and her attempts at jokes are not funny.Now you know.She is a girl from the poster. Perfect in every way but only in a still frame."
"Frankly, I was underwhelmed. The plot is derivative: ""Ferngully"" out of ""The Matrix"" by the Pilot episode of ""Star Trek""; Cameron is so awed by the wonderful canvas he's painting (and it Is visually stunning) that he forgets about developing such things as a story. The romance is predictable - so predictable, in fact that he neglects any foreplay. We all know what's coming, anyway, so why bother? The bad guy is Saturday Matinée Evil, our hero's introduction to the clan is Way too easy (he's accepted with only a token argument; the rest of it is about his ""Manhood Training""), and the Climax is Exactly what you'd expect from a formula that says Good must fight Evil by being Just as Bad***, in addition to being made of Rubber and Luckier.On the Plus side, the music by Horner is nice, though reminiscent of ""Titanic"" in spots, and the Palette IS absolutely Awesome. It's Almost worth the price of admission as an Art Exhibit. I gave it almost every star I did because of the scenery. Without it I would have been hard pressed to come up with one.Which is why, if you're going to see it, you really should spend the extra to see it in 3D.All the way through I kept hoping that Cameron would at least produce an ending worthy of the great art work. Perhaps the spiritual energy of the planet would mass itself and produce an energy field that made the weapons of the baddies useless. It would have shown that Good really Is stronger than Evil. After all, I kept saying to myself, he Did hang the idea that the entire planet is one organism on the wall (Its an old theatrical maxim: if you hang it on the wall in the 1st act, you better be prepared to use it in the 3rd). He Should do Something with it.I should have known better. Nobody would go to see it. Absolutely No Box Office appeal in non-violence. The teen age males among us (chronologically or emotionally) got their money's worth. it's got some ""Transformers"" in it, too."
"We All know that Cameron is a genius. The man ha made some consistently fantastic films since 1984. 12 years after the behemoth which was 'Titanic', he gives us Avatar.It's mixed bag unfortunately, and it's as if Cameron has borrowed from some of his other movies just to get a head start in the story arc.The obvious movies he has borrowed from are the Abyss and Aliens, with their discovering life/war connotation respectively, and Cameron keeps with the protection of the loved one/parental instinct issues he has used in his movies since 'The Terminator, which is all good stuff, but after all the hype and the trailer, the film is decidedly more 'okay' than awe-inspiring.the effects may be the best i have seen on screen, and the 3-D really adds a whole new life to the movie. Cameron knows how to make a spectacle, and the last 45 minutes of the movie are probably the most amazing thing you will see on the big screen for a while (and i mean big screen, there are a lot of films with better endings, but for pure spectacle, you have to hand it to Cameron).the cast are good, Worthington again proves that he could be the next big thing for a while, and the rest of the crew are solid. but the poor film suffers from the hype button being pressed too hard for too long.i was expecting something that not only would change the ways movies are made (i know thats asking a lot), but would deliver a solid story and character development, with good narration.all the technical stuff is absolutely spot on, and it will no doubt win awards for effects, editing, sound and so on. but the narration and the script were in desperate need of tweaking.at times i wondered whether i was watching a film by an egotist gone mad, a work of art, the smurf movie or the most expensive sci-fi ever made.time will tell.a good film, but just over-hyped too much."
"hmm, 12 years, 400 million $ ?? all for this ??? i mean yea, the visuals were outstanding, but "" the movie that is going to change film making ??? "". No way !!!. because 1. the only thing that this movie has managed to do better than any other movie ever made is manage to get the budget, but thats about it. the plot is so weak and obvious that ( like someone already mentioned )any body who has seen a few movies in their respective lifetimes can predict the plot. But in spite of the dull plot there are many other good things in the movie, like the action sequences, yea, they were pretty good. the best ever in a movie ??, no way !!! lord of the rings was better !!! and WOW !! how diverse is PANDORA !!!??? a handful of creatures and a lot of borrowed stuff !. plot holes are too many to even count.you know whats the most intriguing part of this all ?? why did cameron take 12 long years to get the flimsy plot right ???any way, probably i'm a lil too disappointed by the movie and the attention its getting.watched it agen, had to change ma mind"
"did this really get delayed a decade? Why? So they could make sure they stuck to the formula? So they could steal part of the ending from LotR? Hadn't they seen Dances with Wolves yet ? Weren't there sufficient characters in DwW to steal? Let us count the ways this script was pabulum1. usual sexist, racist Hollywood PC BS. Every white guy is evil except two. Jake, who really has to turn into a blue-guy to stop being evil & the other scientist/avatar, who was not evil but was basically incompetent at everything & really a non-event in the script. Otoh, there is a female &/or minority ""doing the right thing"" everywhere we look. How uplifting! I guess there must not be many theaters in China yet, since none of the ""good guys"" were Chinese. There's 6 billion or something people waiting to be pandered to. 2. about 1/3rd of the way thru, I said to myself ""I'll bet jake & the evil security guy will end the movie in hand-to-hand combat. I'm hoping he gets impaled on a hot steam pipe & the steam keeps coming out, like in some Governator movie."" ... Check! Though, I will give it a minor award for creativity b/c it wasn't actually jake versus the evil guy. It was Jake's mental avatar versus the evil guy's mechanical robot/avatar. Nice little touch. But killed by arrows? Cowboys & indians comes to the 2010s. 3. when the battle started turning against the ""good guys"", I said to myself ""I'll bet the trees will come save them, like in LotR."" Check minus! I was close. It wasn't the plant-life but the animal-life. Wow, so unique. I'll bet P. Jackson is blue with envy. 4. Lest we forget the really dumb suppositions, (I'm sure there is a better cinematic term but unlike most imdbers, I never flunked out of film school) how about when we see Jake having meetings with the evil white guy(s) during the day or taping his thoughts during the day. So, what is his avatar doing, napping? ""Hey, wake up blue dude. It's 2 in the afternoon."" Oh, maybe he did most of it at night? Right, the guy lived on 2 hrs sleep/day. And then there's the idea that the indigenous blueies, who are supposed to be the paragon of simple virtues, who innately understand good versus evil, real versus fake, etc. will open their arms and take as one of their own a freakin avatar, a dreamwalker. The blue chief-to-be, you know, one of the ones who came over from DwW, said it correctly early on ... ""he's a demon in a fake body."" that is exactly right. The blue paragons of virtue would have accepted him about as much as they would have accepted having a McDonalds built at the foot of their hometree. Crikey.Random thought ... Will G Ribisi win Best Facial Tics in 3 sec appearances Oscar?"
"This whole movie is just Pocahontas in space. In fact, let's take a look at the plot summaries for the two movies; (Male protagonist) leads a rag-tag band of (soldiers) to the New World to plunder its riches for (Male protagonist's homeland) - or, more precisely, for (Male antagonist), who comes along for the ride. Meanwhile, in this ""New World,"" (Native Chief) has pledged his daughter, (Female protagonist), to be married to the village's greatest warrior. (Female protagonist), however, has other ideas. She has seen a vision... a vision she believes tells her change is coming. Her life does indeed change when the (space)ship lands near her village. Between (Male antagonist), who believes the ""savages"" are hiding the (rare, valuable substance) he expected to be plentiful, and (Native Chief), who believes these newcomers will destroy their land, (Male protagonist) and (Female protagonist) have a difficult time preventing all-out war, and saving their love for each other.Granted, it's better than Colin Ferrell's 'The New World,' but why do we need another retelling of Pocahontas? We don't. But everyone will lap it up anyway."
"As I sat groaning with boredom at the tired ""indigenous population"" theme hacked up all afresh for the new decade, I pondered on many possibilities concerning these particular ""not so little"" indians: Wonder what their life expectancy is? infant mortality rate? death rate from barbaric maturity rituals? etc., all typically left out of the deification of the indigenous population theme in every Hollywood treatment of such... wonder why? Next time we go back, lets be sure to take more beads, firewater and smallpox laden blankets. Maybe that's upcoming in AvaTwo, ""Big-Little Horn."" Oh, and let's not forget the Idyllic ecosystem, where every entity is quite literally ""plugged in."" Intellectually and politically dishonest tripe with no character development (I want my legs back! I am an evil military man! I am a thoughtless corporate wonk! I am the fiery, independent femalien! I am the crusty and arrogant scientist with a heart of gold!).Finally, Giovanni Ribisi is miscast more thoroughly than in any of the thousands of roles in any of the thousands of movies I've ever seen.A perfect movie for the WalMart masses.4 stars for good 3D."
"Seriously I would have given this movie 5/10, but to balance out the ratings I gave it 1.What surprised me the most is that those people who give this movie high score in their reviews, actually admit that the story is rather clichéd, basic and weak, they rate special effects NOT the movie itself. I guess silly me always thought that a good plot is essential for a movie to be great.People's approach to cinema is rather scary today, I don't think that its because people are dumb, I reckon more and more people just want an eye candy to make their escape from grey days easier, and the sweeter the candy the easier the escape.Can you please at least stop giving this movie in particular high scores just because of the effects and start giving them based on other criteria like: story, characters, script!"
"Graphics is what saves this huge production. The rest of the movie is pretty bad. The story is the same old formula done so many times. Good natives and bad modern technology guys. Spare me HUH! The politically correct references are crude and many. Yes, we heard it all many a times and every time we are supposed to be impressed of how innovative and observant the director is. Iraq and Afghanistan are the wars of American oppression to steal oil from the peaceful natives. The hints are very ""in your face"". The whole thing stinks and worse of all it gets boring after the first hour. Character development, Cameron fails miserably. Dialogues are flat and predictable. The whole ting is predictable. Saving grace is the computer generated graphics and fancy battle scenes. Imagine how many good movies could be made with the $300 Million that was wasted on this dog."
"Look...everyone is a film critic. Everyone has an opinion. But what I cannot stand is a section of society who decide from early doors that this film was going to be *beep*. Reviewing a film from a You Tube trailer? After the 12 years of work that went into this film...where is the logic.Thankfully the film is getting the much deserved critical acclaim it deserves. Avatar is a modern day masterpiece that has embraced a new generation of CGI and has single handedly proved the value of 3D as a visual tool: Pandora is not a real world but I was convinced otherwise while sitting in that screen...I was literally taken to another place.Actors were all solid, action sequences crisp and well scattered through the film and as for the ""weak"" ""unoriginal"" ""rubbish"" storyline...I had no complaints. In my eyes JC has notched another film that will be remembered for all the right reasons in 10..20..50 years. 3 words ""GO SEE IT"""
"Few words don't describe my experience watching this Magnificent Epic. Ramayana is an Epic story in Indian Mythology. When i read Ramayana, my imagination of each and every mythological character have made an everlasting impression on me as a child. Now watching Avatar meant i never stretched my imagination reading Ramayana. What i liked the most - 1. Its a Humane story told in a Touching style 2. Message on saving our environment. 3. Characterization 4. Splendid technical wizardry at the same time high emotional quotient 5. A simple narration 6. God...i cant take few reasons. Everything ..e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g is at its best.James Cameron - What have you done to us ? KG"
"but story-wise,this movie has gotten all its' Oscars in 1991, when ""Dances with Wolves"" was in competition. I'd say James Cameron wanted to reinvent 3D cinema, and not cinema, as it's been stated so many times. In this aspect, Cameron delivered, indeed. The 3D landscapes and rides on top of dragon-like birds are the strong points of this movie.But is there any chance that this will become a classic ? I don't think so. This movie has more clichés than a crime-mystery book of the '50ies. If you saw ""Dances with Wolves"", or ""The Last Samurai"", then you know already everything this movie wants to tell you.Visually, you can see remnants from ""The Abyss"", warfare machinery from ""Matrix Revolutions"" and in what acting is concerned, the only two performances that caught my attention were those of Stephen Lang (colonel Miles Quaritch) and Zoe Seldana (the CG character of Neytiri). Disappointingly flat performance from Sigourney Weaver (can't help to mention that she had the only ""avatar"" that actually looked like her). About Sam Worthington, if you saw him in ""Terminator Salvation"", you will notice that he only made it from supporting role there, to leading role here. Same-o, same-o.So my advice is, go see it only if you have a 3D cinema near you."
"James Cameron returns to the director's chair to bring us AVATAR that rises above being just another special effects feast that just sets to show off its big budget and groundbreaking CGI, the difference between AVATAR and many other big budget effects films is that here the effects work in service to the story and showcasing a splendid vision of what Pandora really is, a mystical land of both beauty and danger and lifeforms never seen before.The storyline and performances are beyond reproach and the direction, well its James Cameron the guy brought us ALIENS, TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS, and TITANIC, could it be anything less than great? Overall, its a visual effects feast that is really a feast and must be seen to be truly appreciated."
"you have to go & watch out for yourself. it technically sounds great. oh my god 3d effects are awesome. Cameron a great director.he had put lot of thought in it. its a great movie after Terminator 2. u can see terminator like machines. this is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.."
"Worst movie I've seen in a while. It's pretty to look at but it doesn't give the viewer any reason to want to look at it for a whole 2 and a half hours. The dialog feels like it was written by an elementary school student and it feels like James Cameron is just insulting his audience the entire time. I want to say that if I was a little kid I would have enjoyed it more but then I look at mainstream kids movies and realize that most of them are actually better than Avatar.synopsis: SPOILER ALERT White man comes to reap the natives land of all its resources. One of the white men infiltrate the natives to understand them and win them over. White man falls in love with native. War between whites and natives. Natives are weak and can't defend themselves Guess who saves them? go on guess....The WHITE MAN. Unites all the tribes, teaches them that they can tame an animal they didn't know they could, and gets help from their deity which they didn't know they could do. END SPOILERSPeople are going to say that if I was watching this movie for the story then I was watching it for the wrong reasons. I wasn't watching it for the story. I saw the trailers and heard the movie was in 3d so I thought ""fantasy setting with groundbreaking special effects in 3D? Sounds like it might be a good time"" WRONG. After about 20 minutes I dozed off for about 10, I woke up and wished that I had stayed asleep because it would have been a better use of time than watching this piece of garbage."
"Yes, I was able to see an advanced screening of James Cameron's long awaited science fiction film, Avatar.So, what's good about it? The visuals are among the best ever seen, the planet Pandora truly comes alive, and the creatures, wildlife, etc. All look fabulous on the big screen.What's bad about it? Cameron's trademark lame dialog is back, as well as his less than ordinary scriptwriting. The characters, with the exception of Signorey Weaver's scientist character, and Stephen Lang's Colonel Quarritch all feel wooden. The hero doesn't feel alive, he feels generic, and I felt the bad guys ""humans"" were cardboard caricatures. Not to mention the story is far from original. It's basically Dances With Wolves/ Pocahontas meets Aliens.What's the story about? (SPOILERS AHEAD!) In the future, Marine soldier, Jake Sully, (Played by Austrailian Sam Worthtington) is a paralyzed veteran, whose twin scientist brother was killed. The Resources Development Association, a greedy energy corporation, similar to the one used in Cameron's Aliens film gives him an opportunity to take his brother's place in the Avatar program designed by the RDA to infiltrate the natives of Pandora called the Navi, who stand ten feet tall, have blueish skin and act like Native Americans, plus they speak English. (What a surprise!) The RDA have brought in a group of marines led by the evil Colonel Miles Quarrich, easily the most interesting character of the entire film, to make sure that the Navi are displaced from their home so that the RDA can extract a mineral called ""Unobtainium"", which is worth $20,000,000 an ounce, since the Earth is in an energy crisis. The film has some of the greatest visuals ever recorded on film, but after a while your eyes can get a little exhausted from seeing every little detail in 3D. After Jake's introduction to the Navi by ""driving"" his Avatar body, the film slows down as Jake and his new found love, Neitri, played by Zoe Saldana, fall in love, and Jake discovers how the Navi tribe works. But, time is running short, Quaritch and the RDA want to displace the Navi, by force if necessary, to mine the unobtainium from the Navi grounds.The ending involves marine equipment of every sort, gunships, robotic suits, etc, all while the Navi face them down with flying dragons, dinosaurs, bows, arrows, etc. It's one of the grandest visual effects scenes ever put on film.All in all, how did I feel about this film? Well, it's certainly an improvement over Cameron's previous entry Titanic, but his clunky dialog, and shoddy storytelling are still present, and most of the characters really aren't fleshed out very well. Worthington's Sully doesn't really feel alive, Saldana's Neitri is basically Sully's Navi love interest with little to do. Giovani Ribisi's greedy corporate shrill, Parker Selfride, is a whiny irritant, and Michelle Rodriquez, plays a sympathetic marine pilot who does little in the film. Only Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine and Stephen Lang's Quarritch stand out among the crowd. Where Cameron succeeds is in the technical aspects of the film, the visuals, by Peter Jackson's effects company WETA digital, are first rate. Also, most of the action feels unoriginal since we have seen a lot of this material in Cameron's far superior Aliens film. Plus, it never even comes close to reaching the heights of his best film, 1991's Terminator 2 Judgement Day. Plus as I said earlier the dialoge is borderline retarded, hearing lines out of Quaritch's mouth is so bad, I was hoping for some cotton balls for my ears every time I heard one of his annoying speeches. Not to mention the logical thing for the RDA to have done was to negotiate with the Navi for the unobtainium instead of taking it by force, but then again, Cameron doesn't want to use logic, he sees corporations as the ultimate evil. Very little gray in this film. The RDA is evil and the Navi are good, end of story.Would I see this again? Maybe, maybe not, but the slower aspects of the film and some of the dialog are very irritating to listen to. My wife actually got a migraine headache from wearing those 3D glasses for over two and a half hours.To sum it all up, the visuals shine, the story lags, and the dialog is awful.Avatar is not bad, but not great either. I would say it's average."
"Visually stimulating, sure. But the most unoriginal plot I've seen in years, not at all creative. Not worthy of the James Cameron label. Unfortunately, I don't see why so many people have gone crazy over this film. Obviously, they were stunned to retardation by all the shiny visuals and brightly colored landscapes in the movie to the point of not realizing that they had seen this exact plot a million times over. There is nothing original in this movie, no creativity in the plot, no in-depth thought or great work of art. It is visually stimulating, and much like a blonde chasing a shiny thing around a room, it is dull and dumb to anyone who has more than 2 brain cells."
"The first twenty minutes, although we're quickly force-fed the plot of a crippled marine going to a planet called Pandora where his counterpart ""Avatar"", clone to the indigenous natives, will seek trust in these tall blue Na'vi (all this happening while he, in human form, lays a tanning booth and guides the creature) in order to abduct a mineral to take back to earth (symbolizing oil, of course)... isn't bad, seeming as if a young James Cameron, who directed ""Aliens"", ""The Terminator"" and ""The Terminator 2"" with flowing precision, is at the helm. We're on a terrific adventure and it looks pretty neat. But then something happens. Once within the forest, separated from his fellow troops, the Avatar discovers he digs the peace-loving natives more the banal humans, falls in love with the hottest of the tall blue elf-folk, and after taming a flying dragon and bedding down the babe, he's ""one of the gang"" way too quickly. Most of the action of the film's first half, pitting our hero against forest-dwelling predators, is (in a visual and directorial sense) straight out of JURASSIC PARK; the thrills eventually taking a backseat to drawn-out new-age ceremonies and cheesy dialog too horrible to repeat. And when the big battle ensues: The Honest Natives Vs. The Greedy Americans (of course there are a few good Americans, not including the director) - the hollowly undeveloped characters get lost within the expensive flash. AVATAR, filmed in 3D but with 1D everything else, in trying to blend science-fiction, fantasy, romance, and a big bright moral message, ends up mirroring Cameron's view of the American Military: overwrought, overpriced and completely brain-dead."
"I have no idea how this movie continues to get listed among the greatest, and why it soared so high when it did. Every word spoken is forced, unoriginal, one-liner quality annoyance that should be left for high school plays.The story is no different than Pocahontas on a different planet. The most predictable movie I have ever seen. Borderline plagiaristic."
"I have noticed a lot of critical comments on this movie come from conservatives who dislike its allegedly ""liberal"" message. Let me say, first off, I am very politically liberal and progressive, consider myself an environmentalist and certainly abhor racism, and I really disliked this movie.The story is simply idiotic.Are we supposed to believe that it is commercially viable to send a massive spaceship -- that must literally cost more than the entire world's 2010 GDP to develop, build, and operate -- on a 12-year round-trip mission to Pandora just to bring back ""unobtanium""? How does ""the corporation"" know there will be a market for it when they bring it back? If humanity has developed the technology to efficiently power a huge manned spacecraft over light-years nearly at the speed of light, then something tells me humanity can solve its energy problems (or whatever else it may be) without ""unobtanium."" The whole Avatar concept is underdeveloped and compares unfavorably with the similar concepts in the Matrix. Why is it that an ""avatar"" made of a mixture of human and Navi DNA is still an exact physical duplicate of the Navi? Shouldn't it look like a weird hybrid like the creature in ""Splice""? How is it that the avatars cannot think or act for themselves? Aren't they living creatures? Don't they have their own brains? If not, how can they stay alive? Are we supposed to believe that this alien species on Pandora just happens to be close enough physically to humans that we can find them sexually attractive (as Jake does Neytiri)? The Navi just happen to have two eyes, and a nose, and a mouth with teeth like ours, and ears, and hair, and breasts, and legs, feet with toes, etc. etc. They are physically capable of speaking English, amazingly enough. Despite being aliens from another planet, they are far more similar to humans than our closest ape relatives on earth. And of course they all have washboard tummies and the woman have breasts just covered by their necklaces.Does the Navi society have to be a mishmash of every stereotype white Americans have about African/aboriginal/Native American culture? Do they have to be shown apologizing to animals they hunt and kill? (Does it really matter to a creature if you apologize to it after killing it?) Do the actors portraying the Navi tribes people have to all be of either African or American Indian descent? Do they have to speak English with either ""African"" or ""Indian"" accents and inflections? Does the tribe have to have a male ""king"" and a female ""spiritual leader""? Does Jake's love interest have to be a ""princess""? Does he have to be confronted by an angry ""warrior"" rival for her affections, who he ultimately wins over? Does the tribe really have to worship a big tree? Does the tree really have to be on top of the biggest cache of ""unobtanium"" on the planet? Are we really expected to believe that if the military decided to declare all out war on the Navi that it would lose? That spears and animals could defeat humans who had the technology portrayed in this movie? Avatar is an insult to the thinking moviegoer, even more than Titanic was. Most of these logical flaws could be overlooked if it didn't take itself so seriously. That was the saving grace of the original 1977 Star Wars -- it took itself just seriously enough, but was able to wink at itself too. And it had a lot of wit and humor, which are sorely lacking in Avatar. James Cameron clearly believes that Avatar is the greatest movie ever made. He might not admit it in interviews, but it is painfully obvious he thinks so.He could hardly be more wrong."
"This film is great to look at......but it has a weak story, poor acting, vacant characters, no soul......I can enjoy most things and was very much looking forward to this movie but good god! It was boring, too long and had no emotion, oh and in the end it tried to make you feel bad about being a human.Who thinks this is a great movie...I just can't imagine, no thought want into anything except the visual effects, if this film wins any best movie awards it will be a complete sham!Lastly the film is set a 150yrs into the future and every character is dressed like 2010, even down to the Beckham esc tattoo!"
"Cameron makes another dent in film-making with an experience best viewed in IMAX 3D. But even then, this self-indulgent, overlong, technologically impressive yet coy film gets boring really quick. The groundbreaking special-effects amazes at first, but it doesn't keep you interested like the SFX did in ""T2"". ""T2"" had characters you loved or loved to hate; ""Avatar"" has characters that well you're indifferent to their fate. A good film should include talented acting and a solid story. This film has neither. And Cameron knows it. And he tries to disguise it with jaw-dropping special-effects, which ultimately is just nothing more than an insult to the audience's intelligence and time. The only character you can have any feeling towards is hatred for an arrogant and stereotypical colonel, played by Stephen Lang who can't even deliver a believable performance.** (out of four)"
I ended up watching this movie in 2D and thought the story was garbage and never found the move entertaining at all. My friends kept going to the theaters to watch over and over again and told me to go check it out in 3D... and yet I did go check it out in 3D and I must say the graphics were pretty awesome but the movie's story line was just useless. I have no idea why everyone think's this movie is all that. Yes the graphics are great but who really cares?On top of that I honestly do not understand why theaters charges an arm and a leg to watch the 3D version? Yes the graphics were great but it was not that much of a huge difference from the 2D Version. I still don't understand why the movie theaters are so packed that you can't get a ticket to watch the movie as they are sold as this movie is nothing but hyped out to the max.
"Anyone who comments, publicly and with scorn, that Avatar's plot line is ""simple"" or ""hackneyed"" does so at his or her peril.There are several constructs in virtually ANY form of artistic expression that almost always work: the ""Fish Out of Water"" the ""Faust Story"" and, of course, the ""Reluctant Conquering Hero"" being three of them that spring to mind. How many times you have seen these ""overused"" story and plot lines in evidence matters not. It's human nature to cotton to them (and we're talking human nature from the birth or recorded history, now) and it's the way they are carried out that determines the success of a given project. Did you like the ""Matrix"" films? The ""Star Wars"" films? What about Frodo and his friends overcoming insurmountable odds and defeating the evil Sauron? There's your ""Reluctant Conquering Hero"" in spades. How about ""Dances With Wolves"" or the ""Back to the Future"" movies? ""Fish Out of Water"". And how's about any movie where the character gets more than what he or she bargained for? Your ""Faust"" story. Yes, the simple fact is ""Avatar"" displays, and rather well I believe, all three of these themes. After his identical twin brother is killed, Corporal Jake Sully, a Marine who's been wounded and has lost the use of his legs, is sent to the lush moon, Pandora, and recruited into a mission meant to ease a group of indigenous creatures, The Na'Vi, out of an area that greedy human corporatists covet for its considerable mineral wealth. He's seduced into taking up the challenge by a blood-thirsty military commander, Colonel Miles Quaritch, who promises, in Faustian fashion, that he'll arrange for a surgical procedure necessary for Sully to regain the use of his legs IF he reports back on the Na'Vi's vulnerabilities. Sully agrees and becomes part of a program, which installs his human consciousness into a Na'Vi body, making it possible for his ""Avatar"" to move about freely (without the use of a portable breathing apparatus) on the planet's oxygen-poor surface. During an initial expedition, Sully becomes separated from his group and is left behind. During the night, he meets a NA'Vi princess, Neytiri, who saves him from a pack of wild dog-like creatures. She scolds him for his oafishness and takes him to her people who, because she has seen ""a sign"" sent from the NA'Vi's sacred ""Tree of Souls"", allow him to live amongst them and learn their ways. With each ensuing trip, Sully's ""Fish Out of Water"" becomes better acquainted with the way of the NA'Vi and, finally, he takes their side in the growing conflict. This, of course, infuriates the Colonel, ignites the ire of the mining company, and all bets are off.What happens next, yes, is somewhat predictable. You know the NA'Vi, under Sully's formerly reluctant ""conquering hero"" will be triumphant. You know the bad guy will be vanquished and the mining company sent packing. But, I argue, these are things we WANT to see as human beings and why these devices and themes are used over and over (and over) again. They WORK. So, it's ""all been done before"". So what? Clichés betray honest and universal truths. This is why they are used so often and why they exist, sublimely, as clichés.This film, for all its time-tested, ironclad plot devices, is absolutely astonishing in its newness. We've never seen anything like this planet or its inhabitants, humanoid or otherwise. The visuals are magnificent as one might expect, but it's the interaction between the NA'Vi and Sully and his resulting transformation that are at the core of the film's success. I was amazed by how moved I was by this ""simple"" story, by the kindness and nobility of the NA'Vi and their connection with their land. James Cameron has borrowed some not-so- simple, current real-life human themes and placed them in what is a very timely story, much in the same tradition as great TV science fiction, such as Star Trek TOS and its offspring.That $300 to $500 million was spent to bring this film to life means little as the film will more than make back its money and every single cent is up there on the screen.I just wish would-be movie snobs would shut the hell up about their having ""seen this all before"".The simple fact is, they haven't."
Come on guys... all the reviews i have seen have been a vote of 10. The movie in general was OK... Definitely the best effects in the whole movie history. I can not argue about that. Acting in the real side of the fairy tale was .... OK I will say. The script was to predictable. It started in a quite interesting way but the end was too obvious. Any way overall the movie was good. I just wanted to write a review and break the law of everyone giving it 10. Just because a movie spend millions of dollars does not mean that it has to be the one movie. Again overall the movie is nice but i really do not see the point of booming it with excellent scores.
"Sigh. Where to begin. This movie - the story I mean - had enormous problems right from the start. Jake's brother gets killed for ""the paper in his wallet""? What, paper money in 2154?? And where exactly did he get killed? On Pandora? A small corporate-military-scientific installation? Crawling with common thieves/murderers? Come on!And it goes on from there. All sorts of questions relating to the events and characters are never explained. What on Earth is unobtainium (an unoriginal term) used for, since it's so expensive? No explanation. The characters are total cardboards, incapable of mustering any audience identification or sympathy, with no cool lines, no good acting performances (except Zöe Saldana's), no nothing. The story is predictable and made up of clichés. I liked the ""Gaia plug-in"" thing they had, but having all the animals rise to the occasion at the end was just too Disney. The greatest plot hole was that the military could just have nuked the site instead of using a conventional assault. When they get back there next time, they'll probably do exactly that. So no proper closure, nor believable behavior, given the available technology.There were some cool scenes, sure. But without a good story and good characters and capable actors, cool action is utterly meaningless. This was a pretty package with no substance, just what you expect from average, mainstream Hollywood fare, made by a director who's compromised his integrity for money. The script sounded like Cameron wrote it when he was twelve, way waaay before getting around to mature and masterful work like Aliens and Abyss.This is the kind of movie that, because it contains something new (the CGI), will be a big hit now, but in just a few years it will be outdone by other movies and quickly look dated, and the cheesy story will relegate it to history's dung heap, deservedly forgotten.I had hoped this would be the SF movie of the decade. As it is, it's unintelligent schlock which will probably be toe-cringing to sit through a second time. What a freaking shame. 2009 only had four really good SF movies: District 9, Star Trek, Surrogates and Battle for Terra (which may have been made in 2007, but was released in 2009 - it is a much better version of Avatar than Avatar). Avatar certainly doesn't make my top-250 - nowhere near.6 out of 10."
"I was one of the millions of people eagerly anticipating Avatar, buying any magazine that mentioned it, watching interviews with James Cameron, until the day finally came yesterday as I sat in front of my nearest Imax screen, tingling with excitement.And it didn't disappoint.From the first 3D shots of Pandora, Cameron manages to engulf us into this strange new world. Every detail has been considered, from the curious new species to the tiniest falling leaf that hovers in front of our eyes. If the planet looks special in the daylight, as the night falls it is nothing short of magic, with its ambient glows and delicate attention to detail. The world Cameron paints becomes somewhere we envy, somewhere we begin to empathise with, and therefore urge on the characters as they fall under human threat as it is cruelly destroyed.Most criticism Avatar has had has been situated around its 'poor story line'. This is simply, in my opinion, not accurate. I, like so many others, felt fully engrossed in the story, helped on no end by the likable Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and the wise and mystical Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). This combined with the indisputable excellence of the CGI ensure the audience is immersed fully in the plot. Although it may be argued that the story line is un-original, it is the way it is told that truly makes the difference. Many films have similar core stories, but it is how the film maker chooses to tell them that is key. Avatar, seems to do so with such brilliance it at times becomes overwhelming.I left the cinema in awe, wanting to go back into this new world Cameron has created. And I will certainly be watching it again."
"I remember watching this in the cinema back in the day. I sat through a fim and tought, okay there will be a character that does not react the way which is totally predictable. But... there is not. It's like a childrens tale with CGI nothing more. Everything in it is black and white, there is no grey. The - not so - subliminal (political) messages are also mega annoying: the evil white people occupying, murdering etc. the poor indigenous tribe, nature against technology, spirtualism against science etc. At the end the happy blue smirfs win and in their grace they let the humans leave the planet...
Unfortunatly the next step in which the humans a) nuclear bomb the planet hardly b) throw down some niche chemical / biological weapons to exterminate all the Navi, is not shown.The film also represents a bad step in Hollywood history. This was a financially very sucessful film that had a very thin, incredibly cliche storyline and a lot of visual effects. It paved the way for films which want to excel only through visuals and think it will all be allright if they skip the story."
"I still remember when this movie came out, everyone was talking about it. It was one of the highest grossing films of all time. The graphics blew everyone's mind. Yeah, it just didn't really do anything for me. I agree, the graphics are stunning. If you want to get sucked into this world with the CGI and the animation of all the animals, go see this movie because you will be pleased. But the reason this didn't really work for me is the story. It's a story that's been seen a million times before. Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas did this story, and it was old back then. I know a lot of people really liked this movie for it's graphics, but personally I have to be engrossed in the story to be engrossed in the movie. I also think that the villains were weakly developed. They're just the generic bad buys. So personally I'm not a fan, but that doesn't mean you won't be."
"The 3D animation was great. Visually a stunning piece of cinematography. However, the story of a tribe that is endangered and fights to protect its environment and habitat is so old and beaten. I got no sense of who the characters are. The storyline is so thin, it is almost invisible. I also did not like how the animated characters looked like a hybrid of a lizard an human being. I don't know what James Cameron was thinking when he developed the faces of those creatures. I believe this plays really well into the narrative of the environmentalists. However, I don't find the parallels with the real world especially from the perspective of how human beings heavily rely on fossil fuels for survival and for everything in their daily lives."
"It was an orgiastic feast for the eyes- I am not big on 3D, but I commend it's quality. Full marks- 3/3 + 1/1 wow-factor. Other important aspects to consider in a film- Dialogue: 0/3- I have writhed at scenes which contain that socially awkward, English humour. This is one of the few films I remember seeing a film where I squirmed on behalf of the writers. Terribly written. Next up, Plot-line- 0/3 Not only is it easy to write a film whose core is ""Person infiltrates society, ends up liking them, and changing sides"", but many have been written pertaining to a Western Civilisation battling Environment- Fern Gully being my favourite. I can't wait till the era of 'supermodel' films passes."
"This movie is one of my Top 5 favorites!I was blown away by this whole amazing world that jumped out of Cameron's mind. It is not only a visual firework but also very detailed and accurately designed.Furthermore it is one of the very few movies I think 3D was worth inventing for. It supported the viewer to be drawn into this world and created a link to all the individuals in it, kind of like the ""Tsaheylu"" which made the movie even more emotional and dramatic. I was overwhelmed by the beautiful nature, frightened during the big battles, sad when the Na'vi lost their home and felt joy when I flew with Jake over Pandora.The movie simply had everything to amaze the viewers. That's why I give it 10/10.I'm really looking forward to part 2 and 3!"
"I had higher expectations from this film, being a great fan of James Cameron's previous work, such as The Terminator and Aliens (his two best films, in my honest opinion), but this film simply disappointing. It is pretty much a vessel for testing special effects and is perhaps Cameron's worst film after Piranha 2, that's it, it is Cameron's worst proper film.The main problem of this film is simply that it is to dumb: it has the plot of a Saturday morning cartoon and the characters lack any depth. So Cameron simply recycled the plot that was already used a hundred times before to test drive these new special effects. In essence, this film's only strength is its visual spectacle, which is amazing and that's why I gave it 6 points, otherwise it is just a boring dumb film."
"I really went in the Cinema hoping to see something worthwhile, i imagined the story would be horrid and the acting mediocre, but i never dreamed even the action would suck. I'm a big time Disney classics fan, I've probably seen them all a few dozen times, so i think i picked up that it was a derivative of Pocahontas in the first 30 minutes. But somehow they managed to turn such a beautiful story upside down and up its own ass with hippy environmental junk spewing out its mouth. Having good Effects is insufficient, in 30 years, all movies will have that, and this movie will just be a bad memory. The acting is horrid, if that... The best part about the action, is the build up to the action, its like listening to Carmina Burana and just halting it when its about to go to the epic choir."
"i had the lowest expectations for this film and i was right. dear god i literally fell asleep 3 times while watching this movie. its too long. i like James Cameron i do. he has had great movies such as terminator 2, true lies and terminator. this is one of his worst. this was a total waist of money to even put this movie out. and then they put out so many copies of this film like a directors cut, an extended addition, 3D, regular copy,enough. and they want to make a sequel. also the plot was boring predictable, typical, and not right for this film. this should of been nominated for razzie awards, not Oscar awards. the only good thing , the special effect.no avatar 2 please. don't see it."
"Avatar. Supposedly the best film ever made by James Cameron. I have to disagree. The film blew me away when I first turned it on with the amount of effects used. I had never seen anything like it. It has redefined movies by far with what they can now do with motion capture and blue screen. The story however was basically Pocahontas. Bad men trying to mine planet. Natives fighting back. One of bad men becomes good man. Throw in a hummingbird and a raccoon and you've got yourself Pocahontas. Surely James Cameron could of made up a brilliant storyline with some twists and turns such as the Terminator Movies or one of my favourites of his True Lies but simply taken another storyline which has been used before. However the film has its ups and down and I didn't get bored watching it. The action scenes were amazing and when the tree was blown up, that blew me away. All in all a good film but just tweaking the storyline would of completely changed my mind."
"I happen to be a huge fan of Cameron but I saw this with a few friends recently and found myself feeling guilty for having convinced them to go with me. Visually, it was a fantastic film but that's all it had to earn any fanatic response. The story itself I found boring, repetitive, and completely unoriginal. I even found the acting to be quit weak. I don't think Sam Worthington did a fantastic job with the character but I doubt he was casted with any great expectation of great delivery as was the same for Arnold in Terminator.I think the worst part of it all is that the studios are transferring every movie into 3D just because of the outstanding worldwide grosses for Avatar. But they're being lazy with it as well because so far they're just rushing into the process and not even shooting these movies in 3D. Instead, they're reformatting movies in 3D as was done with Clash Of The Titans which was horrible (another poor performance by Worthington) and The Last Airbender. This whole thing is turning out to be one huge glut fest."
"-- WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS -- There is no doubt, the visuals and special effects for ""Avatar"" are stunning. It is a wonderful movie to look at, and James Cameron deserves credit for helping to advance the use of CGI in movies to the high level that they are at today. That being said, the plot and characters are tissue thin and predictable. In the first 15 minutes, you know that Jake and Neytiri will fall in love and end up together. You know that the Na'vi will somehow defeat the humans and defend their world. You know that Colonel Quaritch will be dead by the end of the film. You're even reasonably sure that Dr. Augustine will die (cause after all, in a movie like this, one of the main characters has to die, to add emotion to the film). As with far too many of James Cameron's movies, there is no room for any complexity in the characters. The Na'vi and their human allies are unquestionably good and pure, while the soldiers and the corporate stooges are uniformly evil, with a cartoonish super-villain quality.As an aside, there's one other place where I have a major problem with this film. This is a universe where man is very technologically advanced, and has mastered interstellar travel. So, of course, when fighting a war on a distant world, the humans use...helicopters? They couldn't even dig up a couple of old F-16's to use? All that technology, the ability to travel between solar systems, and the best flying vehicles for use is a slightly better version of the Huey's the US military used in Vietnam? Obviously, this was done so that the Na'vi would have something slow to shoot at during the final climatic battle scene (kind of hard to make it seem realistic that bows and arrows, or even those flying dragon creatures, could bring down an airplane doing Mach 2), but it feels contrived, as if Cameron thought ""I have to make sure the humans don't use anything too advanced, or I won't give the Na'vi any chance to win"". It's lazy story telling at it's best."
"James Cameron has done it again. He surely knows how to make a movie that captures the fancy of viewers of all ages and from all walks of life. While the actual story is good, its only novelty is that it is based on the distant planet Pandora, and visitors must be put into a cryo-cooled state for the long journey, then awakened upon arrival. Other than that it is a standard story of peoples from different backgrounds with an unlikely love story interwoven. Think Pilgrims and Natives, John Smith and Pocohontas, Romeo and Juliet.The ""hook"" in this movie is the creation of the hybrid Avatar, which has both Earthling DNA and Pandorian DNA, so the resulting being, grown in large pods that simulate development in a womb, emerges fully grown, and is very tall and blue. But this Avatar can't function on its own, it must be controlled by its Earthling, the one whose DNA was used. The Earthling enters a special compartment, and via special electrodes is able to see through the Avatar's eyes, speak through it, run, fight, and everything else through it. But when the Earthling is disconnected the Avatar falls into a deep sleep and remains that way until the Earthling activates it again. This can be tricky! So why are they doing all this? One, to study the Pandorian race, whose atmosphere will not support Earthling life without a special breather. So the Avatar solves that problem. But there is also a rare metal, Unobtanium (I chuckled at their choice of that name!), which is desperately needed on Earth, but the richest deposits are in the ground under and around the Tree of Life where the Pandorians have made their main home. The peace-loving scientists want to gain Pandorian cooperation to have them move, but their religious connections make that unlikely. The competing group are military and their motto is, if they won't move peacefully then lest blast them out of there, let's incinerate them.The main character is a crippled man, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully. His identical twin brother was to control the Avatar Jake, but unfortunately was killed so Jake, having the same DNa, made him a match. But he had missed the special training. His love interest is the Pandorian, Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is the site scientific leader, Dr. Grace Augustine, and she has her own Avatar.The militant leader is Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch. And the commercial leader, pushing for something to be done is Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge.The animation is superb, the motion-capture technology, which was NOT part of the DVD extras, must have been exotic to enable them to make such realistic looking characters. You really forget you are looking at animation. I didn't care for the extreme fighting and military action in the last act, but overall a very good movie.SPOILERS: It looked like the militant Earthlings were going to be successful in destroying the Pandorians and their society. But Jake, getting to know them, turned his talents to help the Pandorians who ultimately prevailed. Then, at the end, a way was found where Jake would fully inhabit his Avatar, and the old Earthling Jake would die. he ended up as a Pandorian himself."
"I must say that I have issue with the naysayers when it comes to this movie. People are just too hard to please; I think proving the point that people will find issue with anything no matter how good it is. My guess is that most people have absolutely no ability to understand the level of work and creative ability, amongst iron will that went in to making this movie. I read that Cameron moved into a hotel right across from the Fox lot for several months before the movie opened, working day and night on the delivery process alone. He demanded that it be the biggest experience possible for all viewers (this was a simultaneous worldwide event). It brings to mind Leo DiCaprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes in The Aviator. Now, I don't know if Cameron jousts himself into the grasps of obsessive compulsive insanity but it wouldn't surprise me, and I applaud him for it. He is a visionary, and when it comes to that quality, like all great artists, it must go his way. It is his vision and his alone. I'm sure he has made more sacrifices in his life for his various feats than most could possibly fathom."
"I went in to this with no expectations what so ever (if anything I was a little skeptical, there has been more than a little bit of hype after all), and was blown away. As movie experiences go, this one was up there with the original ""Star Wars"" series and ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"". Why? Well, the the cinematic technology for one thing, you really should see this one in 3D. Another reason is that just like the previously mentioned movies this is essentially a fairy tale, and just like those movies, this one proves how effective that can be when given an epic big screen treatment. However, this movie is different in that it does not play it safe. Unlike ""Raiders"" the designated evil is not the most reviled regime and ideology known to man, nor is it a generic evil empire. In fact there is nothing generic about the imperialism in avatar, and of course this is going to rub some people the wrong way. I am cool with it, however. I am down with Avatar, baby!"
"If this film did not have the special effect of 3D I would have given it a 1 out of 10.To be fair, I went along because I was curious to see what 3D film was like these days (the last 3D movie I saw was some kind of space adventure from the 80s whose name I fail to recall).I could see that they were using a kind of Philip Marlowe/Apocalypse Now narration-by-the-principal-character device straight off, but this didn't bother me to start off with because I was initially very impressed with the 3D.However, after about 30 minutes (once you got used to the 3D) you began to realise just how bad the script was. Let me point out now that there was nothing wrong with the acting - the actors were doing the best they could with a bad job - but the clichéd lines in the film started to grate and I find myself looking at my watch after 90 mins.That was a shame because I then had to put up with almost another one-and-a-half hours of this awful script; and it didn't help that my girlfriend had lost all composure long before the end of the movie and began screeching with laughter at the poorly written dialogue. I was just cringing and hoping that the Colonel would die soon so the movie could be over...I just don't get Hollywood. Why spend all that time and money on special effects, quality actors, only to deliver a bum script? It also didn't help that there were so many references, mainly visual, to other films. Apocalypse Now was borrowed from a lot, as was Dances with Wolves (which itself was a ripoff of the far superior Little Big Man), and even from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I found the plot highly insulting, especially since I have actually spent time in the Ecuadorian Amazonian jungle with native South Americans whose habitat (the forest) is being encroached upon by oil companies exploring for black gold.The narration device did not work and narration NEVER works unless it has a sense of humour. Kubrick used it a lot - the narration in Barry Lyndon, for example, is very dry and witty - but Kubrick knew what he was doing. It works in the Philip Marlowe private detective movies because it helps to convey the cynical nature of the Marlowe character (and it is also funny).I can only think the script was written by committee and those behind it were thinking how the movie could appeal to the widest audience: the new age/environmental constituency (""OK, let's get some Dances With Wolves-type stuff in there""); action/war movie fans (""How about some Apocalypse Now? And hey, why don't we rip off that scene where Kilgore is drinking from his mug of coffee while the Air Cav are wiping out the Cong?""); and, of course, the kids (""As well as the 12 Certificate, we need to get some dragon-type things in there like they had in LOTR..."") Unfortunately, it ended up with a dumbed down script which was a real distraction from the visuals. As I said before, the 3D was good but it wasn't good enough to carry this film. I was curious about the 3D, but my advice to anyone looking for a 3D experience is to go and see Alice in Wonderland (surely with a genius like Tim Burton directing it, it can't be as bad an experience as this).I must thank the Electric Cinema in Notting Hill, though, for having comfy seats and allowing me to take a bottle of champagne into the viewing!! Otherwise this film would have totally ruined my Sunday..."
"I did not see this movie in 3D (horrors!). What difference would it have made anyway? I felt as though the evil Mickey Mouse Disney CEO from the ""South Park"" episode with the Jonas Brothers was constantly present on the Internet and TV, telling the ""Avatar"" promotional staff and message board writers that, regardless of the plot, we, the potential audience, should not forget that ""it's in 3D...don't forget to mention it's in 3D!"" Is film now just about technological spectacle that we should totally disregard whether the storyline is a bunch of garbage? Is this what cinema has come to...just enjoy the 3D, and give us the Oscar? How crass! At least the Ray Harryhausen movies didn't pretend to be anything more than entertainment. ""Avatar"" thinks it's something better than entertainment. It's a preachy allegory that rams its message down the audience's gullet, using stock characters that have been in vogue in sci-fi for the past forty years.Even without 3D specs, I enjoyed the computer animation. Pandora (why this name? I'll get to the annoying allegory presented in ""Avatar"" later) is stunningly beautiful. The aliens DO express genuine human emotion, like grief and joy, very convincingly. Kudos to James Cameron for using the best state-of-the-art CGI techniques to make the Na'vi look realistic. The computer animation for the aliens most certainly DOES NOT look fake. So, King of the World, a tip of my regular specs (in lieu of the 3D ones) to you!Now for the plot...here's where I'll have some fun and be evil by to peeing on the King's parade! The villains symbolize the evils of mega-corporations in our own world. Then again, this theme has been done to death in far better movies, such as ""Alien"" and its Cameron-directed sequel and ""Robocop."" The protagonist's union with the alien tribe, and his relationship to the evil conglomerate, is reminiscent of a film that came out earlier in 2009: ""District 9."" I'm not saying the King of the World and the ""District 9"" people had a pizza party together one day and swapped plots over cans of Bud Light; but, there is probably plenty of plot repetition in Hollywood because there is a dearth of creativity. Great minds, contrary to the platitude, do not think alike; mediocre minds do.I did like that Cameron made the aliens primitive hunter-gatherers rather than high-tech space explorers. In a sense, the Na'wi, who literally live in the trees in a green forest moon, are Ewoks, expect not as cute and cuddly. Anyone who has seen ""Return of the Jedi"" will start to wonder whether Cameron visits Skywalker Ranch for some R and R with George Lucas, where both men extol their own wealth and genius. The Na'vi are, like the Indians in Westerns since the 1970s, ""noble savages"", with a pedestrian New Age spirit. They LITERALLY commune with nature and worship Mother Earth, whom they call Eywa. Paging ""FernGully"", Dr. Cameron? The fact that Pandora is alive is a thinly-veiled reference to the Gaia Hypothesis. This idea was presented without any preachiness in ""South Park's"" ""Lice Capades"" episode and George Carlin's monologue, ""The Planet is Fine."" I hate being preached to by a man who, ironically, consumes plenty of Gaia's resources by virtue of being wealthy (we're all guilty of raping Mother Earth, by the way, but ""Avatar"" simply wags its finger at us and doesn't offer any practical solutions).In all, I must repeat... ""DON'T FORGET IT'S IN 3D!!!""P.S.: I rate this film as highly as I do because the actors do a hell of a job, in spite of their clichéd characters."
"I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters and all 3 were in Imax 3D, which made the film even better. James Cameron is a genius when it comes to making movies that will make money. So far two of his movies, Titanic and Avatar, have made over $1 billion.I thought that the acting was good from Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, and the rest of the cast. I thought the visual effects were mind-blowing throughout the entire movie.I felt that the script and the directing were both brilliant. Almost every bad review on this movie says that they ripped the story off from another movie, which I can not think of any. I would really like to know! Overall I would give this movie a 10/10 stars and it might be the greatest movie ever!"
"Many people have criticised this film for not being original, after seeing it I would be inclined to agree, but would not hold it against such a breathtakingly brilliant film. Though in many ways you could compare this to Dances With Wolves, they are comparable in plot alone and it certainly does not detract from what, in my opinion, is a masterpiece of modern cinema. Cameron has truly outdone himself with this one, not just because of the phenomenal box office success but because he waited, patiently for the technology to catch up with his idea. Avatar truly encapsulates Pandora and draws you in hook line and sinker; it makes the world utterly believable and draws parallels to the destruction of our own world.A true work of genius and completely deserving of 10 stars"
"Obviously the effects were breathtaking, and one really should see it, especially in 3d. The plot was nothing new; basically it was Pocahontas in Star Trek land. There were a lot of unrealistic situations in the film that kind of bugged me (the NA'Vi accepting Jake, being able to remotely control a body, tribal aliens defeating technologically advanced humans). I would compare it to Star Wars: Episode 4, in that it had the next level of effects, but Avatar falls in Star Wars shadow. I also believe that if the film was made with all of the same characters, dialogue and plot but without the great effects, than most people wouldn't think anything of it. I'd say that it deserves an Oscar for effects, but nothing else (directing, acting, screenplay). Overall, the film had the greatest effects of any film in the past, needs to be seen, but doesn't deserve to be praised for an original screenplay."
"Just watch that episode of South park instead. It was considerably over-hyped, and The CGI was just ""okay"", and every time I was almost impressed I could think of being considerably more impressed by the visuals I've seen recently in silly things like video games. I did not find it even slightly enveloping because for one the aliens were so awkward looking! and not to mention that neither the science nor the logic of using the science made any sense whatsoever, I found no incentive at all to suspend my disbelief. The story was simple and quite honestly very boring. I had heard before hand from a g4 interview with James Cameron that it was a very ""tree-huggy"" story and I thought I could stomach it, but it went a lot further with HEAVY elements of Native American and African ""spirit of the planet"" worship. The odd ""mating scene"" while not sexually explicit was incredibly awkward and entirely off putting. I got up and left before the climax but after most of the movie was done, and I only stayed in the theater that long because I thought everyone else in my party was enjoying it, they hated it almost as much as I did. My biggest regret is that we contributed to the revenue of this terrible, terrible movie."
"If this was the movie James Cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen, then maybe he should have taken better notes, or should have taken a very sharp editor's eye to his script.Because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic CG of any movie today, the plot is almost insulting in how stale, cliché'd, and just plain boring, ordinary, and generic it is. There's no surprises to be had; you know exactly who's going to win and who's going to lose, you know exactly how different action (not just fight) sequences will turn out, you know exactly what characters will live and which will die, which ones will have an abrupt Heel-Face turn, and which ones will turn out to be good all along.The only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects.Right from the start, the film does wonders with visual effects, showing us a highly realistic-looking sleeper ship, and a zero-g environment on board, that neither looks overly cartoony or overly CG'd.Cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail, but neither does he rush through details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script. It's a perfect mix of showing us nifty creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think he's showing off.The Na'vi start off looking quite real, but very blatantly CG. There's a slight sense of artificiality in the Avatars when they are first on screen, and shown awakening and interacting with humans. But as the movie progresses, the effects seem to get better and better, to a point where towards the end, when Na'vi and Humans interact, both of them look incredibly REAL, as though the Na'vi were a huge puppet, and yet it's entirely CG.Where they went all-out with the visuals, they completely lost it with the story. It becomes less ""Avatar"" and more ""Dances With Wolves In Space"".But the story doesn't treat this as a surprise. Nor does it even try to be distinct. You know exactly how characters are going to react to situations. You know exactly what's going to happen next. You know that the Generic Nerd Sidekick appears jealous and resentful of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) now, but you know later on he's going to become the HERO who tries to save him. You know that Sully is going to be initially hated by Action Girl Love Interest (Zoe Saldana), but eventually get her to love him, You know that Bad Ass Action Girl (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to betray the humans and side with Sully and the Na'vi. You know which characters are going to die. You know that Sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe. You know that Sully is going to admit he's been spying on the Na'vi, and cause Action Girl Love Interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away, You know this and that and everything.It's all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring, and you wouldn't have ever noticed that fact if the movie weren't so much fun to look at.But while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in, the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the Na'vi themselves... and the Na'vi themselves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly realization: ""They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!"" They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.It would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of ""Dances With Wolves"", and that would probably be a great discussion point, but like a great many modern ""PC"" portrayals of Native Americans, they sugarcoat them so much, they become just as racist as the Savage Red Man (Blue Man?) portrayed in older stories.These Na'vi Americans are so in touch with their environment, they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals' heads.They can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the ""Tree of Souls"" to pray directly to their God. They have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal. They use bow and arrows, ride on animals, and make yipping sounds like the Natives in old ""cowboy and Indian"" movies.It wouldn't be so bad, and it never really ventures into a racist depiction (especially since most of all these are ALIENS and not Native Americans), but the parallels are too strong to ignore---this is not even a metaphor or parody, these Na'vi are nearly word-for-word copies of stereotypical Native Americans.But since these AREN'T Native Americans and they ARE aliens, James Cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the ""in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature"" good guys, whereas the Humans, with the exception of only the obvious ones and the Nerdy Pacifist Scientists, are all evil, greedy scum who can't do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources, as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on. THANKS FOR THE FAITH, CAMERON! It's a stereotypical ""White Men vs Indians"" tale of the 90s, with the evil Humans being thwarted by the holy Na'vi.And yet we get the Unfortunate Implication that the Na'vi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of Jake Sully, White Man Sky Person.THANKS FOR THE SUBTLE RACISM, JAMES CAMERON!"
"So what do I mean when I say I eat my words? Well it annoyed me that the fact that James Cameron was the sole reason to see Avatar. Yes he's a renowned director but I don't even consider him in the same league as a Spielberg or a Scorcese (not that I am a huge fan of Scorcese personally.) I didn't quite understand the ""visionary"" everyone thought he was. Yes he's done some solid action/sci-fi flicks and yes he managed to direct Titanic to record breaking greatness but was this enough to base Avatar solely on? Well I miss the Titanic of boats because James Cameron's decade long labor of love might be at the very least one of the great film epics ever made. Hands down if nothing else Avatar is the most visually stunning piece of film you will ever see (and I didn't see it in 3D YET.) As many have said the CGI in the film which is practically 99% of the entire film is nearly flawless and the work put into the Na'vi people especially the main characters is just amazing. Add in the fact that there are some genuinely incredible performances and an entire world built from the ground up and sci-fi lovers will be floored this creation. It still won't be the type of film to reach out to all genres but it is quite possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.Sam Worthington is quickly becoming someone to watch for in Hollywood. He leads the cast in Avatar with skill and a brooding personality. Unfortunately for him Worthington is not the strongest in this cast. He does well and yet his character doesn't have nearly the depth of some of the others. Still this should do amazing things for his future. Zoe Saldana on the other hand is mind blowingly brilliant. She gives the performance of her career and does it all behind the shadow of a CGI character proving that talent and brilliance can shine through even in voice and computer capture. Her character shows so much incredible emotion and is so brilliant, she should be given an Oscar just for those merits alone. She is stunning. Sigourney Weaver slips back into sci-fi brilliance as Dr. Grace Augustine. She goes through a range of personality changes but is definitely a character you can feel empathy for. Yes she also smokes in the movie...please get over it. It's a character flaw, millions smoke. And just as a side note this woman who is a lovely FIFTY NINE YEARS OLD...looks incredible. Stephen Lang gives us a performance that just may be one of the great film villains of all time. First of all he simply looks bad ass. Second of all he gives a strong, surly, performance that admittedly is a little two dimensional (get the irony) he serves his purpose as evil villain and pulls it off amazingly. Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi (amazing cameo role), Joel Moore (great character actor) and the entire cast that play the supporting Na'Vi characters are all brilliant in their own way. Some stand out more than others but the entire cast comes together perfectly.I just always though director and writer James Cameron had a run of good luck with Titanic and his earlier works in Aliens and True Lies and creating the Terminator world. But when you look at his body of work he's never done a bad movie. The man knows science fiction and Avatar has really been his thesis, his ultimate show and he accomplished it in a big way. Maybe I'm over hyping the film but it's just been a really long time since I was riveted to my seat, transported like this film did for me in the theater, make me want to see it again the moment the credits wrapped. If you are one of the people who has not contributed to the 1.4 billion dollar take I suggest you get out there and add to it because this film deserves to be #1 film of all time. I can't go right out there and say my favorite of all time yet but top five at the very least. Let's face it Titanic was your Grandma's movie...this one is for us. You are King of The World Mr. Cameron...the world and Pandora. 10/10 and then someADDITION---February 5th/2010 I had the pleasure of seeing Avatar for a second time and saw it in 3D. Was it impressive? Yes. The technology is very impressive and looks cool. Did it change the entire face of the movie? Sorry folks...it didn't for me. The movie is incredible but its incredible because its Avatar, not because of the 3D. I'm glad I saw it and it was on an IMAX screen so it was explosively cool but the movie is great on its own and gains very very little in 3D except a lot of depth."
"I did read up about comments here and external reviews, before I went to see the movie. I expected a bad story and stunning visual effects. I got to see a very bad and very predictable story and I thought the visual effects were not that good.The panoramas were nice, certainly. The graphic world was nice, with the forests, the alien creatures, the huge machines and planes of the humans. But I thought it was very well visible that it all is CGI. It's animations. Why would people say that you can hardly see it's CGI... do they think we're stupid? I've seen computer games lately that look just as stunning. And in 5 years, we'll just remember this movie as ""nice graphics for its time, but the story sucks"".I agree with the reviews of Avatar being a mixture / ripoff / remake of Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, FernGully, Last Samurai, Enemy Mine, Lawrence of Arabia. Cameron did a much better job on Alien and Terminator. Did people finally convince him that his audience is stupid? I did quite a few face-palms while sitting in my chair. I started drinking a lot (thanks to our service cinema for providing this lovely feature), because I was bored. Predictable. As soon as I saw the main character sit in his wheelchair I knew: he is going to one of those Na'vi. Predictable. As soon as I saw the huge tree, I knew they were going to blow it up. Really. Barf.I still don't understand why humanity of 2154 needs a whole fleet of airplanes to cut a high tree, since we already have neutron bombs now. You want to eradicate the aliens, get the tree out of the way, and not let the public at home know you did something terrible? Throw the neutron bomb and nobody will know. The area will be easily accessible with big digging machines, because there will hardly be any radioactive fallout. I know, it's evil, but that's the way these evil humans are in this movie. But that would be a short story, wouldn't it.Go see Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Aliens, Terminator, Silence of the Lambs... or so many other films. Nice stories, some unpredictable plot changes and ditto character developments, grey (vs black&white) characters.I happily would give it a 1 / 10, but I did like the graphics. I did not like the plot, the story, the characters, the character developments."
"the visuals are great even superb, however like titanic it is fatally flawed and like titanic in 1 years time people will vote this either best film of all time or worst film of all time. it is neither . the hype however is not matched by the film, a good cartoon is still only a cartoon. if anything this shows up the major problems with this kind of film. however much you try to make a cgi character look and act like a real actor it can't be done, try going to see a real live play twice and see how the actors vary and improve performances. Here we have the nearest a cartoon can get to a real film, that is Cameron's triumph, but a hackneyed script and weak dialogue make it seem like a bad episode of star trek or lost in space. This may be the way forwards for film but not yet!"
"Awesome movie with great facial expressions of the characters. Really a treat to watch in 3D. Though i feel the movie sprints in some steps rather than going on smoothly in a single flow. There are some cliché moments like when the hero decides to tame the big bird and in the next moment he is seen riding it over the tribe, when they are praying. But still it has got a nice dose of emotional interplay between the characters.At the scene when the big tree is being destroyed, you feel that by some chance somebody might be able to save it.But it has dealt with some harsh reality. We can also take a cue of it being linked to the issues of global warming/ environment protection etc. Cause at the end the movie gives a subtle hint that in order to survive with the nature you must adopt it rather than destroying the balance nature always seeks to maintain."
"This movie was a mind blowing experience for me! It marked me for eternity. First I have to say that it is made to be watched in 3D and on a huge screen so the IMAX is just perfect. The explosion of the colors is not affected by the filter of the 3D glasses and the IMAX huge speakers make you feel in the center of this amazing universe and of the action. The pace of the action is correct, the balance between all the elements (love, war) is perfect, you just don't wish for the film to end and I can't say that there is moment when you are bored, 2H40 were not enough for me! And the visual effects! And the colors! And the characters!...A sublime feast for the senses, a unique, outstanding film to create history!"
"This movie cannot be put into words. It is visually stunning. The plot is enough to keep you interested. Nothing spectacular. But like I said, the visuals suck you in and refuse to let you go until the credits roll. The world that James Cameron has created is so beautiful and surreal it almost overstimulates your scenes. You walk out of the theater feeling bored with the real world. Mind you I did see this film in 3D. And if you ask me thats what makes you feel like your part of the movie. If more movies where of this caliber, I think it would breath new life into people going to the theaters instead of watching it on you HD big-screen with surround sound and all that. Hands down the best experience I've had in the theaters. You need to see this."
"And so much more. If this movie doesn't sweep the audience off their feet through the whole thing your in a coma. I watched it 2D tonight and will be back to see it 3D after X-mass. There was nothing disappointing about this at all. It was worth every dime James dropped making this beautiful film come to life. If there is anything left on the cutting room floor, please pick it up add it to the DVD release and I'll happily buy it. I am floored. And I'm not easily impressed. There are parts of this movie that reminded me of the book ""The Chess Men of Mars"" With the multi-legged animals and the flying Tarns. But it all looked so real. The color is fantastic its all eye candy. anymore. Awesome, just awesome. Fry"
"Avatar opens your eyes. Not only to a new world, but revolutionary visuals hand crafted by the master that is James Cameron. No wonder it took him 15 years before he knew that it was time to create this masterpiece. The whole cast do great turns in their roles, the cinematography is awesome, the music thrilling but most of all the visuals, as they explode on screen in a cacophony of colour, shape and sound, are breathtaking. Especially in 3D, never before have I felt to really have been in that world whilst watching in the cinema. Many times during certain scenes I literally suddenly realised I was in a cinema rather than in the deep, dense, flowing forest of the planet Pandora. Cameron really has excelled here and does not disappoint. If there was one little grumble it would be about the story, which is slightly bland (jungle battle of guns against bow and arrows for land). Nevertheless, this is quickly forgotten in the pure amazement, sheer spectacle and timeless awe of the world that is AVATAR."
"Avatar is a rare movie. Not only is it a stunning example of CGI, excellent writing, and acting that truly brings characters alive, Avatar is a movie that has a story worth telling. Today we are surrounding with movies, especially science fiction, of repeated stories of alien invasions, war, battles, etc., Rare is the movie that has all of these but actually has a story with telling within the CGI and visuals. Avatar is that movie.The year is 2154 and humanity has begun colonizing other worlds. Pandora is a world rich with resources and former marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is chosen to replace his brother on a mission that would hopefully change humanity's role on the world. Crippled though not defeated in spirit, Jake is willing to do anything that could get him back the ability to use his legs and the Avatar program may be just that and perhaps something more.His arrival to Pandora opens up a world that is beyond imagination. Working with Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who makes her disdain towards Jake openly, Jake is thrown into the Avatar program where he mentally takes the form of one of the Na'vi who are the native people of Pandora. At first seeing his mission as a marine would, Jake has no problem gathering intelligence for Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who leads the military contractor wing that provides security for the mining operations on Pandora.Jake realizes that there is something more to Pandora and the Na'vi once he befriends Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). He becomes accepted by her tribe slowly once he begins a series of rituals that teach him not only how to understand the Na'vi, but to become one. Jake one day realizes that he is torn between his loyalty to his own race and marine identity and his new found people, and love, for Pandora. The battle that comes is one that will not only decide if Pandora will survive, but also if Jake will remain the man he once was. Pandora, a world of beauty and innocence, is facing its greatest challenge and Jake becomes the only man, and Na'vi, able to save it.There is a spiritual theme that runs through Pandora. The idea of environmentalism and new age thought runs through the Avatar but not in a way that is forced or condescending. Unlike other movies that preach a message, Avatar lets the idea of defending what is pure run freely and it is this that makes James Cameron's writing one of the best this year. No matter your religious beliefs, there is a spiritual message that is in Avatar and one can compare the corruption that humanity brings to Pandora much as sin did to the Garden of Eden. There are those who will not like this but that is okay. Even if you don't enjoy the ideology behind Avatar, the movie is still one of the best this year. James Cameron deserves best credit for what is one of the most original movies ever made.10/10"
"I think it deserves a 10 in the votes so I gave it a 10. I don't want to say too much about it just now, having only just seen it. It is very dreamy and well worth it. I avoided seeing too much of it and reading too much about it in case I found some spoilers before going to see it (I hate that) but yep I doff my hat to you Jim Cameron, well worth the wait.One thing I will say, I was a little worried about it being just another American propaganda vehicle to war. I was lucky enough to be in a scene as an extra, and the scene I was in had a very typical American raise to arms and although I had to act all keen about what was been said, inside I cringed ""I raised my eyebrows and thought oh-no"".Thankfully, it wasn't just another vehicle to war in the Middle East. JC is Canadian after all I guess."
"After I saw Terminator 2 at the cinema when it first came out, I had to recover for a day or two. When I started getting my thoughts in order, I realised two things: one, the film had state-of-the-art special effects running all the way through it and, two, those effects were always in service of the story, and never the other way round.Some consideration of Cameron's filmography makes it clear that, while he is a director who is keen to push the envelope - The Abyss and Titanic also come to mind as movies where effects are pushed into new areas (and I include physical effects as well as photographic and CGI), there is always a strong human heart beating in the film, and you never find yourself thinking that here is a filmmaker who has discovered the bundle of tricks which is CGI, now what can I hang them on? (koff koff Roland Emmerich anyone?) So I watched Avatar on two levels - what it looked like, and what it felt like. As it happens, that's not a bad basis on which to review it, notwithstanding that the essence of successful film-making is that the two should be inextricably tied together.So what does it look like? I'm a sucker for eye candy, and the answer has to be ""Absolutely stunning."" Breaking the visuals down into sections: The human locations and hardware are very reminiscent of those in Aliens, and the powered exoskeletons (viz Ripley's fight with the Alien queen in Aliens) make a reappearance, big time; The Pandora vistas are both sufficiently earth-like to enable you to identify, and sufficiently other-worldly to place you on another planet; The Pandora flora and fauna are spectacular, and brilliantly well thought out. I particularly loved an element which hasn't been shown in the trailers, involving the plaits which the Na'vi wear.Do you believe in what is shown to you? Well, for the first few moments you marvel at the eye candy, and then, yes, you accept what you're seeing. In particular, the Na'vi are real people within a few minutes of meeting them. I was disconcerted to find myself quite fancying an 8 foot tall skinny blue woman with cat's eyes.The 3D is also amazingly effective in immersing you in both the gritty human locations and also the alien world of Pandora - do try to see it in 3D if you can.But what of the story? Let's be honest, you're likely to have encountered this tale before. Technology-heavy invaders are determined to acquire a natural resource: unfortunately, this resource lies under a particularly sacred site belonging to an indigenous tribe (think Amazonian rain forest, think buffalo herds), so someone is sent to infiltrate but ends up seeing the beauty of the life pursued by the underdogs, and changes allegiance. Factor in a romance between the infiltrator and the chieftain's daughter who is delegated to train him, and you have a formula story which is likely to be quite familiar.But it's unfair to level that as a criticism. The reason it's a familiar story is that it's a good story. Filled with tension and audience sympathy for the underdog, it works as well here as it has worked in previous incarnations, and the science fiction trimmings add complications and additional story elements. You do genuinely care for the plight of the Na'vi, and you want the romance between Marine Jake Sully and his Na'vi princess to turn out well.I must say that Cameron's films generally - and Avatar is no exception - are not films which are going to rank as great cinematic statements. What they are, without exception, is fantastic big screen entertainment - they engage, transport, and carry you along. They are rattling good yarns, delivered by a master storyteller. And, again, Avatar is no exception.Cameron said that he wanted to make a film where you wouldn't be able to tell where real life ended and CGI began - he has achieved that. And he also said that he was aiming to create CGI faces which the audience could accept as real faces, and which didn't have the deadness behind the eyes which we have seen as recently as Zemeckis' A Christmas Carol. I think he has achieved that, too. If nothing else, this is another of Cameron's films which will stand as a milestone of technical achievement, but it is also a hugely entertaining movie, and one where the story comes first."
"Avatar is possibly the most over-hyped film to be have ever been released this decade. Despite a rumoured budget of around $300 million, the film itself is a complete failure which lacks as much in substance as it does style. The main cause for this disaster, is primarily because of the one dimensional direction from the so called 'King of the world' James Cameron, who, previously had delivered two exceptionally great film's- The Terminator and Terminator 2. Almost every single shot throughout the gigantic and over-long running time consists of panning shots and those similar. Once noticed, it's only a matter of time until you begin to get agitated. Character development and a cliché'd narrative doesn't help a lot either, and further drags the film into it's failures."
"I went to see Avatar a few days ago, and I must say I didn't like it at all. Of course you're able to see where did the money went, CGI characters are amazing, backgrounds... I mean, everything in this movie dealing with technical issues is great.But, where's the story? Where are the reasons why characters do what they do? I really don't care if computers today are so powerful you can create the perfect flying monster, with every little detail you can ever imagine (skin, veins, breathing movements...) You only need one thing to get all that: money. But great stories are not about that. And this, obviously, is not a great story. It's just the excuse to take 3D a step forward."
"Wow, the images. If I were stoned, this would have been a great film, because it doesn't require any thought. None. Nothing. Titanic was a tired love story. This is a tired commentary. The story is banal. Everything ""fits"" because it was created that way. There is no social discovery nor dialogue, in fact it would barely seem clever to a caveman: ""business bad, environment good."" But, if you are not interested in story line (probably because you find Stephanie Meyer clever), then you might actually like this trash because of it's awesome CGI...If not for the technical superiority, this movie would have already been forgotten."
Brutal is a word to describe this movie.Basically its the re-telling of the American Indian saga when the white man shows up and destroys their way of life. The language they speak in the movie even sounds like Navajo. Its Dances with Wolves and the General Custer battle at Little Big Horn. James Cameron needs to be afraid of legal issues as he stole the entire plot from other movies.For the first hour of the movie its a sensory delight. Special effects heaven but you then have another 2 hours of heavy handed environment issues and the killing of the native people.Good luck and don't feel bad if you leave midway through the movie. The special effects are worth a matinée price ticket
"Will people please stop giving this film 10/10? 10 for visuals and effects? Absolutely. 10 for plot? Script? Acting? Direction? Without the effects this is at at best average film. It seems James Cameron has a slight case of George Lucas-itus. They get more money than they can use, more power than they can handle, and no-one can reign them in. Is this the same director that brought us Terminator? Aliens? Unfortunately not, but it is definitely the guy who brought us Titanic. This film is tired, flabby, hugely self indulgent and at least 40 minutes too long. Oh and 'Unobtanium'? See 'The Core' and at least they had the decency to use it tongue-in-cheek. Although any film that has to steal from 'The Core' is in serious trouble."
"PROs: visually stunning. Breathtaking special effects. Wonderfully detailed alien world CONs: storyline cobbled from Apocalypto, Dances With Wolves and The Last Samurai. Alien dress and culture very closely modelled on Aztec/Inca culture, with the exception of the music which sounds surprisingly like African roots music. Clunking dialog. More holes in the plot than my underpants; note to commanding officer - if you are going to destroy the Tree of Souls, consider spraying napalm over a 50 click area and apply naked flame. Alternatively, drop a large rock on it from 30,000 ft from the shuttle. Also, why send in ground troops when the mission to destroy the Tree of Souls is predominantly an aerial assault?SUMMARY: Wonderful concept and realisation of an alien world culture are no substitute for a coherent plot and decent dialog. Opportunity missed. 4/10."
"Visually, 'Avatar' was one of the most remarkable movies to see in theaters and will be remembered in history because of that. James Cameron once again showed that with virtually a limitless budget he is capable of making something that will cause audiences to say 'wow.' But I urge viewers of this film to strip down the visual elements and see this movie for everything else, because I feel in all other elements it really falls short and does not deserve the praise it is getting. The story itself is one we have seen FAR too often, good vs. bad with the bad always taking just enough time to state their case and intentions at the end to have some 'unexpected' source on the good side sweep in and save the day. I for one have grown truly tired of the predictability of certain films and this film was a prime example of that. It had some promising elements, showing the potential for an inspiring spiritual meaning, as represented by the natural environment. However this promise was squashed and destroyed as the environment showed that when it comes down to it, it's ready to drop itself to the same level of greedy humanity -that is to fight back. If you want to see something in 3D, I'd consider seeing this film, but I wouldn't expect much from in any other respect. I'd say the movie 'Up' is a much wiser 3D choice."
"I think it is great that movies can be used to highlight current social issues, or even past ones - the plight of the Tuskegee airmen, for example, or the Holocaust. I don't even mind ""heavy-handed"" emotional overtones - i.e. the American flag in Saving Private Ryan used to bookend the movie. I'm a sucker for that stuff. But Avatar is not just overblown with heavy handed writing, it actually insults any number of categories of viewers.If one listens to the commentary track of Valkyrie, for example, the writers mention that the obvious ""villain"" of the piece could not have been written as a villain. Hitler's public speeches were almost always about prosperity and peace, he never killed anyone personally, never signed an execution order, never visited a death camp, never witnessed a murder. And so in Valkyrie, you had a quality of which apparently Mr. Cameron is not possessed - subtlety. The only ""mustachio-twirling"" moment, as the writers called it, was when one of the teletype operators is told by his boss to cut off communications to the orchestrator of the coup against Hitler, and he makes a faint smile. That's it. That's the moment of villainy for the film. The rest is cloaked in ambiguity.Avatar, of course, has scenery chewing galore, or would have if not for the excellent actors. Stephen Lang is well known to Civil War buffs is certainly no over-actor. But the writing does him no great service, ditto Giovanni Ribisi, another familiar face to war movie buffs from his service in SPR.What is most insulting, though, is that Hollywood almost always dumps on religion out of ignorance up until the point it can serve a story in some hokey way. The only time religion is used to service a story is if some scientific grounds can be found to 'legitimize' it (in Star Wars, it was mitichlorians, whatever they are, and in this one, it is electromagnetic impulses connecting the trees). In Avatar, the people using technology are stupid and amoral ones and naturally are depicted as faithless. Catholics, Jews, Muslims all get short shrift in films because without some ""scientific proof"" for their religious beliefs, apparently faith alone is not enough. According to Cameron, you have to be able to literally talk to the trees and cute animals, or else religion just doesn't cut it.But I also don't understand the movies in which we're supposed to root for cultures who reject modernization; the message was so heavy handed it just made me angry more than anything. Connect the dots - technology is bad, since evidently it ruined the Earth, and therefore we need to root for blue people who prefer to live in trees and sleep in hammocks without any of our creature comforts. Personally, I like living in a house and having a computer, and watching TV, and a spring mattress, and a gas-fired furnace, and a car with internal combustion engine to take me interesting places, and going to the movies and watching far-fetched stuff that people like Cameron dream up.There might have been a good story in here somewhere if Cameron hadn't decided to beat us over the head with an environmental guilt-trip, with bad guys with razor thin motivations and no ambiguity whatsoever. Far more interesting themes would have been the notion that humans were there to sincerely help, or perhaps the notion that religion and faith are real and legitimate and meaningful without being able to 'prove' the existence of God through scientific means. Sometimes sworn enemies even believe in the same gods - talk about moral ambiguity. I can't buy into a notion that people who make multi-million dollar technology are always of necessity amoral idiots while people sleeping on rocks and eating raw hand-killed food are somehow geniuses with absolutely perfect moral centres. I guess that's why they call it fantasy. By the end, I was cheering for the guys in the helicopters, not because I approved of what they were doing, but because I wanted it to be over with that much more quickly. I simply wasn't buying it; I enjoyed the visual spectacle but the characterizations and motivations of the ""villains"" were about as compelling as Wile E. Coyote."
"This film is totally OVERRATED.... honestly i love titanic and you fall in love with the characters in THAT movie. BUt in this movie, you cant really fall in love with anyone. I had to tell my parents when the movie had started... because they thought they were still watching the previews?! 10 minutes into the movie, you see a marine guy who has crippled legs from war to help figure out the Avatar people since his brother is dead. He is the last one to get off the damn helicopter! There a guy yelling at him to wheel off the helicopter faster. COME on people! This needs a better story line. for like the first 3 hours of the movie he is helping humans and the last 30 minutes he is helping the Aliens... the transition didn't make any sense. He knew what he was getting himself into... why did he do it? To buy himself a nice pair of legs? I mean obviously the guy had enough of war as it is. But wait! All of a sudden he can walk! and run! He can climb mountains, and ride dragons. Thanks to being an Avatar. The love scenes between the blue alien people kinda threw me off too. Im sorry i am not into that. I usually never find mistakes in movies... but when that guy who looks like Napoleon dynamite fights the humans at ground level (as a regular human)... he doesn't wear his safety mask! How can he breathe?The war scene:::Why wasn't Jake clever enough to bring the armored Rhinos first rather than letting the Avatar people be exposed to front line gun fire! He was too busy flying his dragon to think about it, he thought the tribal people would be perfectly fine with their arrows."
"I've been hearing so much about Avatar, how a great experience for the senses it was... although everyone seemed to agree on something: the story line was simply bad.I still was looking forward to experience the film.And... I'm so disappointed!For me the worst problem of the film is that even though it uses the Gaia theory (understanding Earth/Nature/Beings as a single organism) as the main container/message, both in the story line and in the technique is not reflected enough, leaving at the end of the film a feeling of incoherence and hypocrisy. The story line is based on the typical American hero story. Even worse in this film, as it claims a dumb American is needed to save the world. Why are we sold the idea of a Nature as a whole organism when let's face it, It can't seem to do much without a Hero?And about the 3D... why to use a new glossy technology if there is no purpose to the story? Technology for technology sake is never enough. I would have imagined that the idea to use 3D was to convey the idea of Gaia. We are all connected, even the audience. But why are we not feeling the Nature all the time? Being inside it, hearing it...!(the sound for me was not rich enough). In my opinion, the most telling moment was the fact that we didn't feel physically attacked when the Nature was attacked. As spectator I should be feeling the action from the point of view of Nature as well as the point of view of the attacker and the hero! How can we understand the whole idea of the film if we don't physically feel it?So, OK, it's a beautiful film, but it seems the story and how it is portrayed hasn't been thought through very deeply. And it's such a shame to put so much efforts and resources for such a superficial story.Even if you ignore the lack of coherence between the story telling and its supposed message, for all the film's marketing as a 3D experience it is anything but. The characters are so two-dimensional! No troubles, no doubts. Only 'fantasy' super-slim perfect heroes.And I have to admit it, I've spent part of the film thinking how much it reminded me to Distric 9 (although in my opinion that one was much better). Before the aliens where the bad ones, things have to be very bad now that films have given't up on humans!"
"This is a movie that has big money and Hollywood written all over it. OK effects are great and all my points given to this film are purely based on the effects - Oscar awards might be coming this way. However, I prefer story before effects on the movies I like to watch. So story of this movie can be found in dozens of movies made before this one, and the twists on the plot, yep you guessed it right seen somewhere else probably hundred times. And that's why I was quite disappointed with the movie. Only new thing here is the environment where things happen, and the way they have reason to make and use more effects here. So try to enjoy the effects but don't expect new kind of movie story like matrix was when it was new or the first release of star wars saga back in the late 70's."
"Avatar unveils the saddest picture of film critics in decades. In order to praise this shallow, 2D, unimaginative, generic ""world"", the majority of respected and experienced critics had to throw down the toilet all their previous film education so they could hold the candle in the dark while Cameron performs an additional lobotomy on the already over-lobotomized audience. The hypnotized general audience will always bow under the burden of the pompous, constant, direct PR attacks of the studios but that's where the critics should stand their ground. Now it seems their ground is as big as Pandora.In short - The worst outcome of Avatar is a massive self-ridicule of the critics that puts them right where they belong. Down the toilet."
"Original? Original my a... Nothing but another lousy uneducated Hollywood attempt to tell the story of Native American people. Can't even get the story right. Trying to re-tell the made up story of Pocahantas and John Smith, original? My a.... Bows and arrows, horse people of the Plains? Oh yeah, real original. And why not add insult to injury by portraying Native people, (since that's what this crap is all about), as technologically inept with bows and arrows instead of telling the TRUTH that they died in mass through disease. I'm so glad that Cameron finds the struggle of Native people as so entertaining and that the rest of the world sees it as original. Pick up a history book once in a while before passing this sh..off as original. I wanted to vomit, especially with the pathetic and lousy attempt to copy Native language, ideas, and social structure. Yeah, we just love when people try to portray our history without ever having learned about it. Original, my a.... The typical story of the ""indigenous people"" needing to be saved by the all heroic white boy. Same sh.. that's been told or attempted to be told as truth over and over. Pick up a history book Cameron or better yet, why don't you ask the people you try to portray what the real story is. Oh I was especially disgusted by the lines ""we've tried to give them our education, medicine..."" etc, yeah, so original and creative. What a joke Cameron is, a lousy joke."
"If you enjoy idiotic cartoons and you are under 15 years old you might love this incredibly silly movie. How Avatar is rated better than other wonderful movies makes me question the ability of the moronic raters! I do not hate Avatar but I would not rate it higher than 4.5 out of 10. Numerous Philip K. Dick legendary movies are not rated as well ads Avatar (which is very foolish!)! I think Avatar might be a childish SciFi genera, and is not bad for teens or tweens (my children loved it)! But they like lots of Harry Potterish stuff:-) :-) So if you are a Science Fiction fan and have a College degree you will not finish watching Avatar!!! I rated it 1 but as I said it may be rated as well as 4.5 if you are under 17 years old."
"Imagine a man so caught up in the virtual reality world of the online game ""World of Warcraft"", that he neglects his real life, instead preferring to absorb all his time and energies in his online avatar. Imagine that he has a very sad life and this is all he has. The game becomes his life. He starts to believe he is living in the game, and becomes far too attached to it. This can only end badly, right? Wrong. This film will lead you to believe that in the end you CAN be a part of this virtual reality. This film is grossly misleading. It is about the above, but prances around in pretty colours so that it looks otherwise. Mixed in with this and the deus ex machina ending, is a large portion of the Disney film ""Pocahontas"".The amount of hype surrounding this film was ridiculous and, in my eyes, made it even more unlikeable. James Cameron's head is clearly so far up his own backside, he can't see what is good and what is nonsense anymore (I say anymore, but Titanic was abysmal as well). Who is making these films!? WHO?? Apparently Hollywood is an incestuous pit where people do whatever for the sake of favours and what not. This film is an embarrassment. Go home James Cameron, go home."
"One word from me that suits it perfectly 'EPIC'! its exactly my kind of film! Bit of Scifi bit of action, a good story that you can understand and overall an unforgettable film. Good use of CGI and good use of actors who suit it perfectly. I love the way they accept all sorts of people on this film and it all works like clockwork! It works well and has a lasting story that you cant predict but feel like you already know type thing... if you understand. :P Couple of bad parts in the film but i shall only write a few. One problem is that why after all this time we happen to be the invaders and we know better and we have unbeatable technology but we still lose thanks to one individual? hmm bit lost there. Overall a Good Film. I find i can watch it anytime and still enjoy it. Magical ingredients and actors make this a great film to watch! A well Deserved 10/10 i think! thanks for reading and happy reviewing!"
"Avatar.... This Movie was one of the best SFX movie i've ever seen. It almost shows a new world. However some people call it ""Unreal"". There are a Lot movies which are unreal, like you cannot imagine a person wearing cape and a black mask (The Dark Knight) saving the city (my favourite movie though). You cannot imagine that a ""Spider Bite"" is going to give you Powers of a Spider (Spiderman). It doesn't Matter that the movie is ""Real"" or ""Unreal"", what actually matters is that it should have a great story. Avatar had a Great one, and a Mind Blowing Concept, its action sequence is Extra Ordinary. This movie conveyed a Message that how greedy humans can be for what they need. Desperately Waiting for ""Avatar 2"".Wanna watch a Great Action Movie which conveys a Message, then Avatar is a Must Watch."
"OK. I finally saw the much-hyped Avatar. Currently has an IMDb rating of 8.6. Really?!?! 8.6?!?! Yes, the special effects are cool, but without the effects, this is barely watchable. The story is truly predictable. Once you see how they can turn a human into one of their own, you know how the movie will end, even though you have a feeling about it 20 minutes in, anyway. All the machines and ships look like things from other movies or TV shows, like Aliens, Robotech, and Star Trek. James Horner does the music and it sounds like a mish-mash of a bunch of his other scores (especially Star Trek ones he did). I had left the room a few times for bathroom breaks and whatnot and did not miss a thing. Also, I would not let a little kid watch this movie. There is plenty of violence where people get skewered and blown up."
"I'm going to be brutal: Avatar is an epic let down.A perfectly engaging movie turns into a run-of-the-mill action flick once we get to spend just a few moments on Pandora.Vaguely reminds me of the Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"". It too start out beautifully, then lapses into a standard surf pop pastiche. But at least it has other verses to anticipate for... Avatar never manages to lure you back in once it dawns on you that you really ain't getting a better script than this.When exactly the downward spiral begins depends largely on the viewer's expectations of what constitutes a decent science fiction movie. If you can accept that interstellar travel is possible in less than 150 years from now (quick and dirty patent fix would be to add zero), you'll get to Pandora no problem.But alas, I simply couldn't take it seriously after the ""mental link"" argument. Your mileage may vary. If you try to intellectualize Avatar, you will be sorry. It's an expensive show case what modern CGI can do these days, but to go with a plot of this caliber in the year 2009, and still manage to convince A LOT of folks that they're watching a masterpiece, is beyond me.It actually pains me to realize how much time, money and talent was wasted in creating this. That's the proper ecology lesson I'm gonna walk away with after seeing Avatar.If you want a valid message just watch ""Idiocracy"". Films like Avatar take us yet one step closer in reaching the heights of pure and utter retardedness.I'm sure that's a merit too, though.PS. If you for some reason can't remember why Avatar sucked, here be few reminders:-to accept ""mental link"" explanation is the same as to believe in magic But seeing that humans can suddenly travel in light speed, I would not be overtly surprised if I was told that by then we are also able to somehow copy human memory/consciousness onto an alien-human-hybrid's blank brain... But remote control? That's just.. retarded.-""Oh.. He's a warrior? Never seen one before! Surely we can learn something from him! My daughter will teach you about our ways. Although... your ways surely helped in getting my other daughter killed already. Well, I guess it's different this time around. Have fun now kids! No funny business though!""-the biggest mineral deposit is located right under the tribe's village / Jake is the chosen oneOf course he can ride the biggest dragon, silly Cameron.

"I came into watching this film after it was shown in theaters. I didn't want the hoopla to convince me to get caught up in the Avatar Adoration (though it didn't hold its stay with Inception, so maybe I just overrated its power).After watching this film, I now understand why filmmakers add 3D to their work. They add it because they've got nothing else to put in. Although the settings and creatures were interesting and/or beautiful, it was there to distract you from the story which was pure tripe on a bike. As a quick example, I cheated and checked out how long the movie was before pressing play. 2:20-ish, a long movie by modern standards (not mine, if it's good). So I knew that it would be vital for 0:40-1:20 to contain a lot of action-packed or conversational scenes. In a film ranging from 2:20-2:45, this is the point where the audience will get bored of eye candy and exposition and will need a little variety.At 40 minutes, Neytiri tells Jake that he is like a baby, and needs to be trained. What's going on at 1:20, you ask? He's been trained. Essentially, I wasted 40 minutes of my life watching nothing but a happy-go-lucky inter-species (you know it's true, it was inter-species) romance. For any other film, I would have given this treatment of the audience low marks. And I'm going to do it to the writer of this ""plot."" This is flat-out ridiculous. What does the author think I am, some technophile who can't enjoy a movie without oodles of special effects? Excuse the analogy if you find it offensive, but I see Avatar as borderline pornographic, in a metaphorical sense. Modern porn lacks a story because that's not what people are watching it to see, they just want to see inappropriate things going on while they watch the screen. Apparently, modern movie makers think nobody wants a good story, excellent composition, or interesting characters, they just want lots of CGI. Ironically, Star Wars provides excellent examples on both ends of the spectrum—Episode II had over 500 CGI shots, for instance—just watch all six for some perspective on that.***MAJOR SPOILER IN THE PARAGRAPH BELOW***Now, we see Avatar, a CGI-fest with a complete lack of story, like Star Wars Episode III. Poor character development. I've seen better in teen-written fan fiction of Disney cartoons. No, I'm not exaggerating. Horrific development. If you have insomnia, this movie's plot development is a perfect cure. Furthermore, you can have pleasant dreams about a colorful alien world, because it's the last thing you see before passing out. And you'll probably not even wake up for the part where they blow up the tree.All this said, I will give Avatar a last reprieve—the envisioning of the alien world was indeed attractive. Cameron knew how to appeal to his audience, and he would not back down until he got the reaction he wanted."
"According to me the only thing which is special in Avatar are the special effects.But everything else is absolutely insipid.Before the releasing of the movie I heard a lot of big expectations about it - that Avatar is going to be very deep and the thinking is going to be provoked.That a lot of problems are going to be affected. But what I find is an absolutely flat story line - a bad guy, a couple in forbidden love e.t.c.Everything goes in the typical way with a typical happy end.It's so sugary!Aren't You tired of this romantic stories?Where is the twist?Realize yourself, boys and girls - It's such a cliché!The story line of Pocahontas is almost the same - but its animation with humans, not 3D with aliens.My cortex became totally flat \as the movie..\ when I watched Avatar because there is anything different, anything unexpected .. there is anything which can make your brain working. It makes me laugh when someone says when there is enormous quantity of imagination used for the movie.What I saw is just an Earth with shining plants and there are just twisted heads and few more legs attached to the animals..oh, and the look of the intelligent species is humanoid.Believe me - I'm dealing with biology, and there is no way that an alien species may look in such way even on terrestrial planet.Watch some of the NG or discovery's movies about astrobiology and You'll find a realistic ecosystem with much more imagination used for its creation.Even the name of the special mineral is covered - ''Unobtenium''.Please, look at the last elements from the periodic table and You'll find that all of their names begin with the same suffix ''Uno-''.I can't believe that someone has felt lazy even to piece together few letters and to create a different word.Is this so hard?I don't think so. But when We put the special effects to the sugary story line everything becomes O.K..Because in these days the people probably don't search for something deeper and more complicated than the hackneyed movies which Hollywood is pouring out every year.."
"Okay so let's see... There's aliens...and humans can make avatars to look like those aliens...go into their world...explore it...guy falls in love with alien chick...big fight about the 'taboo'-ness of it...typical climatic battle. OHMYGOSH THIS MOVIE IS LAHK SO ORIGINAL /sarcasmThe only thing good about the movie is the graphics. Nothing else made any sense. I must have dozed off at least 3 times during the length of the movie. Why this movie didn't work for me is that it had no rhyme or reason. Perhaps if there was some underlying plot, some suspense, or at least some (detailed) scientific explanation for the avatars and the existence of the aliens, the movie would have been much better. But all we're shown is that ""So here's this planet and these are the inhabitants. This a capsule, you sit in it and then you look like the inhabitants. Voila! Magic!""AND THEN. The whole cliché taboo love story. So there was no human girl that gave Sam Worthington's character a hard-on, just some gigantic alien...thing (saw this coming). Zoe Saldana's character's family had qualms about it (saw this coming). The Colonel is actually evil who wants to take over this planet (saw this coming, too!). Sam Worthington's character is ready to defy all rules for love~ (saw this coming). There's a big battle, and the army with out-of-this-world artillery lost to a bunch of 7-foot tall winged people.-sigh-. What happened to story-movies? I don't mind watching a movie with shaky-cam and graininess as long as the story is engaging. This was boring, repetitive, predictable, cliché and overrated."
"I don't know why the special effects everyone raved about don't work for me?? This movie had zero visual appeal for me. It felt like watching a mashup of the simpsons with the faces cut from Roseanne. And it was so childish, the script, the characters, the emotional temperature, the plot were all far more suited to Walt Disney. My 6 year old nephew kind of liked it, but even he struggled to believe it was real, it comes off all so fake its like watching a really really long cartoon. Hats off to Cameron for successfully squandering so much time, talent and money to a film pitched at the lowest common denominator. I hope future generations don't judge us by the popularity of this trashy film"
"I suppose when you're trying to produce a film that pushes the boundaries of what is possible and believable in CGI, and probably spend most of your time defending a mind- boggling production budget, it's almost inevitable that you're going to take your eye off the ball on one or more aspects of the project. Sadly, this happens on the story and characterisation of Avatar, with the former well described elsewhere as generic and clichéd, and the latter as paper-thin.Visually, Avatar is without question beautifully realised, and absolutely jaw-dropping in plenty of places, but the thudding predictability of the plot combined with hokey faux mysticism and cartoon personalities often leave your mind wandering, which is never a good sign. In many ways, the film's almost undone by the realism of the CGI, since the verity of the graphics don't distract and it only serves to throw the falsity of these other aspects into such sharp relief. The dialogue also, sadly, deserves a mention in that it could have been written by a 12 year old; even the line 'Sir, I have a situation here!' makes it through the script edit. Lazy hardly begins to describe it.For all the (deserved) brouhaha surrounding Avatar, it really is pretty thin gruel indeed when compared with the efforts of Pixar, where the graphics are simply the vehicle for genuinely moving, inventive and witty storytelling.Worth seeing, but ultimately unsatisfying."
"The visuals in this piece are, for the most part, stunning! Probably a little too much unnecessary CGI (E.G CGI faces never look real, masks would've been more convincing) but on the whole the 'world' James and his visual team have created is quite spectacular. I don't feel the 3D version really added much, I remember seeing 3D in the 80's and it was equally patchy.So the visuals get a couple of stars, the other one goes to Sigourney and Zoe for their actually quite convincing performances, unfortunately this is where the good news ends as Sam Worthington's performance is over contrived and awkward, Stephen Lang as the colonel would have been better cast in the A-Team or Rambo for his OTT stereotypical portrayal of a military leader.But the originality of this piece is the biggest downfall. Design wise everything is stolen from other films, the gyro-copters are from terminator and the 'walkers' are from alien. Most of the environment and half of the so-called story line has been extracted directly from Princess Mononokee so nothing new at all and the 'human-exploitation-of- aliens' piece has been tackled in episodes of Star Trek since time began. I even think they managed to squeeze the presidents speech from Independence Day into the middle somewhere.So in short, if you limit yourself to blockbusters you might like this because it's extremely easy to watch and requires little brain power, however if you're looking for something even remotely challenging or interesting I'd give this one a miss."
"I see many people rate this one-star. They are contrary for the sake of it. This film may not be your cup of tea, but one star? One star says this film is without worth, worthless. Sorry but that is not Avatar.Even if you hated the story, the visuals are amazing and would deserve more than one star. When watching it, you forget about the 3D after a while... and actually the 3D isn't the main selling point, it's just the luscious visuals of Pandora that are amazingly brought to life in this movie.The story itself is quite good, not hugely imaginative, but good enough.But mostly I just can't believe people would give this one star. This film doesn't deserve it."
"Well, first of all, that will be my first review on this site, that's because i really got into finding information about Avatar itself, and also reading other reviews. But let's get on with it shall we?So if anyone does not know (i doubt that) the main plot, i'll put some light on it: It's year 2154, and main character a paraplegic war veteran Jake Sully (Sam Wortinghton) arrives on moon called Pandora, inhabited by the race called Na'vi. Jake was sent there because of death of his twin-brother, who was a part of the Avatar Program. The ""avatars"" are human-like creatures made from mixed human DNA and the DNA of the native Na'vi. Since Jake has the same genome as his brother, he was chosen to take his place in the program. The whole program is made to improve relationship between the human race and Na'vi. That's because RDA corporation is exploiting valuable mineral called unobtanium located on Pandora. Jake is accompanied by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore). Meanwhile Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) orders Sully, to learn the Na'vi culture, and habits, to help human race in relocating the whole tribe from their home tree. That's all about the beginning, don't want to spoil whole plot. Well basically, i must state this now, Avatar is the best movie i've seen in my life so far. Why is that so? The first thing is that with budget of approximately 300 mln. $, it's a fact, that you'll get a great movie, no doubts. At least the special effects. And of course, they're AMAZING, but oh well, with so-so plot, nice animations and so on won't keep you entertained all the time, you'll get bored. Also, we got a FANTASTIC soundtrack, it's utterly amazing, and i think that acting was great too (Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy, cute badass pilot, great role, bit underestimated though). But i would never imagine, that i'll look for something deeper than special effects in this kind of movie. And (to my great surprise) i did look for something deeper, and i'm pleased to write that i found it. I think that's why people mostly hate this movie, is storyline, or i'd rather say THE STORYLINE. Some may say it's predictable, we've seen it before like hundreds of times, nothing new. And i must say that anyone who said that, is damn right, more or less, but he is. But the catch is that we've never seen this story made in such an epic style. When Jake Sully enters this new world, and must learn different lifestyle of Na'vi with help of Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), you learn it with him, you enter the new world with Jake, you feel all his personal feelings, you're having same thought as he do. You start to think: ""damn, our world really sucks, i'd want to live on Pandora"", just like the main character did. The love story is one of greatest i've ever seen, even it's not a new thing (well, i think we've discovered any kind of love story), but as Jake starts to fall in love with the forest, Na'vi, and Neytiri, you do the same. This movie literally made me cry several times. I had goosebumps throughout whole screening. It's pushing you to reflections about our own world, what we've done to it, that we have forgotten what's right and what's wrong. I think it's solely why people hate this film. They just don't understand it. But well, that's their own opinion, and i respect it. So Mr. Cameron, when i left the cinema, i was thrilled, shocked and speechless, keep it up that way! You've done a fantastic job, you've gain my respect, and made me to think about how we destroy our own world, and what should we do to stop it. Damn i really need to watch it one more time! :D"
"The special effects are stunning (especially in 3D). The story is about some brave mining entrepreneurs on the faraway planet of Pandora who battle tremendous odds to harvest the planet's abundant natural resources. The hardships they face include attacks by the ""Na'vi"" a violent cult of xenophobic religious fanatics. Sigourney Weaver is well cast as an evil scientist who cynically brainwashes an idealistic but naive young marine (Sam Worthington) into betraying his comrades. The film unflinchingly explores the base ignorance and hate of the Na'vi for the human immigrants who are struggling to make a new life for themselves in a foreign land. The battle scenes are stirring but the ending is very sad. I wish the good guys had won."
"Whether you just like Avatar or worship Avatar will seriously depend on how much you buy into its message. Avatar is actually a mediocre movie. The only reason some people are giving Avatar a 10/10 is because they're blindly accepting its themes. For those of us who are old enough and informed enough to know that: a) environmentalism is just another false religion b) most of the indigenous peoples of the world have embraced modern technology and the global economy c) the scientists who disagree with Global Warming are being silenced d) the population of the earth is going DOWN not UP e) global resources (such as trees) are not being over-used and can easily be replenished using modern technology... Avatar is just another piece of leftist, Hollywood nonsense. As many people have pointed out, the plot (and pretty much the entire script) has been ripped off from other movies with the same ""save the planet and tribal people"" theme. Personally, I'm getting tired of it."
"On the distant forest moon of Pandora, the giant blue-colored native, the na'vis, resist the human militarized corporation who wants to exploit the precious metal in the ground of a planet. A group of scientist lead by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who are able to download their mind into human-na'vi hybrid called avatars, are charged to find a diplomatic solution before the forces of Colonel Miles Quarich (Stephen Lang) takes charge. Joining the team following the death of his twin brother is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a former marine who is now paraplegic.Not counting the various documentaries he was involved with, ""Avatar"" is James Cameron's first cinematic outing since his 1997 box-office behemoth ""Titanic"". Was it worth the wait? Absolutely though it is also displays some serious flaws.So let's start with the weak point of ""Avatar"": the story. Not that it is bad. Actually, compared to the plot-hole ridden joke of a script that serves as a lame excuse for a story in most contemporary blockbusters, it is really good, with solid characters. But it is also wholly unoriginal and extremely predictable. Basically, if you have seen ""Dances with wolves"" or ""The last samurai"", you know what will happen in ""Avatar"" (the comparison with ""Dances with wolves"" notably is almost impossible to avoid given that the na'vis are obviously patterned over native Americans. Inspirations from ""Jurassic Park"", Peter Jackson's version of ""King Kong"", as well as Cameron's own ""Aliens"" can also be spotted here and there). This is made even worse by a tendency to phone in most of the plot development. When a na'vi tells Jake that only 5 times in the history of her people has a particularly fearsome monster been tamed, you know that Jake will tame one later, which allows you to predict how the story should unfold. The same way, once the same character tells Jake some action he is taking before the climatic battle is useless, you know exactly how the said battle will unfold. Story wise, ""Avatar"" reserves no surprise: You know what you're going to get way before it actually happens on the screen.Also, in order to better hammer his new-wavy ecological anti-militaristic message (it's worth noting that given the current concerns about climate change, ""Avatar"" could not have been released at a better time as it seems to perfectly capture the current pro-environment zeitgeist), the world of ""Avatar"" is depicted in a way that does not allow any shade of grays: You have bad evil people on side and good pure ones on the other and they don't mix! The brute force of the military walking hand in hand with rich corporate sleezeballs, both aimed at destruction, one for the sheer joy of it, the other for greed and profit vs. humanistic scientists and pure natives aimed at preserving a way of life in harmony with the environment.This could have destroyed any other movie. But sometimes it is not the story you're telling, it is how you tell it. Pushing the technological envelope on the level of computer-generated environment and motion-captured, the movie is a triumph of epic storytelling unseen since at least the last installment of the ""The lord of the rings"". The incredibly detailed and beautiful landscape of Pandora, exploding with brightly colored exotic plants and animals, make for an incredibly immersive experience. And of course, the amazing motion capture technology takes to a new level the foundations laid by Peter Jackson with Gollum in ""The lord of the rings"" and by ILM with Davy Jones and his crew in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead men's chest"" in terms of integration of real actors with digital characters. While most of the time, all the characters on screen are computer generated, we never have the impression to watch a cartoon, thanks notably to the amazing amount of emotion their faces are able to express. Some scenes are absolutely exhilarating (notably the flight scenes and the reveal of the hanging mountains). Moreover, ""Avatar"" serves as a healthy reminder that James Cameron is one of the best action director alive, and that all the Michael Bay in the world could take some lessons for him.I saw the movie in 3D but I'm not sure how much it contributed to the immersive experience that was ""Avatar"". This is the second movie in 3D that I saw after ""Coraline"" and I overall don't share everybody's enthusiasm for this format. After 30 minutes, I usually forget about the 3D, if not for the strain on my eyes, although it is possible the 3D effect mmight still play at an unconscious level to make the movie more immersive. But I overall doubt it and, for me at least, the 3D does not add much: I'm sure ""Avatar"" would have been just as enthralling in 2D.A masterpiece of epic storytelling that even its cliché and unsurprising story could not bring down and a new landmark in digital movie-making, ""Avatar"" is without a doubt the best blockbuster to hit the screen since hobbits roamed Middle-Earth. Welcome back, Mr. Cameron. We missed you!"
Definitely !!!I thought it will be a waste of time...it wasn't. I thought a movie sponsored by McDonalds will be childish and gonna suck...it didn't. I thought it will be just another animated movie...it isn't.....what else to say the strongest two and a half hour this year when a saw the BASTERDS i was almost sure there won't be a better movie this year but as it goes i was wrong. My message for you if you read this and you haven't seen this movie yet go to the nearest cinema sit and enjoy this gorgeous piece of art i highly recommend it. The numbers talk for me 5/5.....
"Many years ago a rather obscure science fiction writer, Poul Anderson, wrote a seminal science fiction novella entitled ""Call Me Joe."" In this novella, the main character is a bitterly unhappy paraplegic who is given the job of mentally synthesizing with an artificially created being in order to settle and develop a planet rich in resources but otherwise dangerous, poisonous, and violent. At the end of the novella, Mr. Anderson posits that science has now found a place and a job for otherwise unusable cripples which gives them new bodies and new lives, and thus a valuable place in society. While Avatar takes this particular concept to a different place from a slightly different angle, the basic idea of paraplegics or other types of cripples being given a new lease on life by synthesizing their mental capabilities with those of another creature, whether Mr. Cameron admits it or not, is Poul Anderson's, and for Mr. Cameron not to acknowledge his debt to this outstanding writer is immoral. I would expect as a minimum that Mr. Cameron would let his admirers know that while he is a great director, he took his idea from an even greater and more creative source."
"Impressive CGI doesn't equal a good film.This film makes it into top 100? ...lol If flashy imagery and effects are all what you want from a movie you will no doubt love this and I highly recommend it to you because that's all you'll get.I would describe this film as a low corrosive lump of fecal horror. A maniac bastardly turd. I would rather drink stale urine from Norman Fowler's arse-pit than watch this movie again. It's filth! It's cack! It's the ooze of a burst boil - I'll abominate you, you towering mound of corrupted slime. It's every utterance is like the slithering hiss of a fat maggot in the putrid guts of a decomposing rat. It's face is fouler than the un-wiped ring of Satan's rectum."
"When I went into IMAX to see Avatar; from the hype I had heard, I was expecting something revolutionary, what I got was an overconfident cinematic mess.Avatar has amazing visuals, whether it is the first time you lay eyes on the Mythic world of Pandora, or watching the protagonist, Jake fall down a seemingly deadly, massive waterfall, the visuals never get boring. But the movie, which is pretty much 3 hours worth of nothing, really gets old.Pretty much the movie revolves around Jake, a paraplegic soldier who with other soldiers is sent to Pandora a world inhabited by the seemingly hostile Na'vi race. The Soldiers are sent to recover the mineral Unobtanium which the humans need to save them from an energy crisis. Since Humans Cannot breathe on Pandora's surface, they must create a Na'vi hybrid for the humans, they call this the Avatar project.From here I thought this movie was going to be one of a kind, it seemed to have an interesting story, but then the movie started to develop. I'll let you see for your self, but everything that happens in this movie i saw coming from as soon as i realised the cliché that this movie was."
"Interesting that the recommendations along with this movie are: Aliens, Alien Resurrection, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Transformers (Cartoon), and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Those movies have so much more depth, story, and character that Avatar could only dream of. Look folks, watch Fern Gully the Last Rainforrest and safe yourself an hour and a half. This is Exactly the same thing. Cameron spent $300 Million dollars or more on the technology of the film and $20 (the price for buying or renting Fern Gully and Pocohantas) on the story. Thank God this didn't win Best Picture. The effects are amazing, but thats it."
"With all the hype about this movie, who could resist the temptation? Well, I ate the apple and was punished.The plot: Somebody was on a mission to subvert an alien tribe; instead, he became assimilated and turned into a fighter for them. Doesn't this ring Dances With Wolves? To send this person to the other world, push a button. Didn't they do the same in a little-known movie called Matrix?Haven't we seen plenty of flying dragons in the Lord of The Rings? How come you Mr. Cameron didn't think of making the trees on Pandora walk and kill the Sky People. That would have been so original! And so many people gave this movie such high ratings. Obviously, while computers become more intelligent, humans are dumber."
"this is the worst sci-fi film that I have ever seen( the effects remind me of Doctor Who). I was so looking forward to and waiting to watch this, that I got side-tracked by the hype.I have been reading, watching and absorbing sci-fi and fantasy for 30+ years and this, without doubt, is the most pathetic effort that I have ever seen. I have just watched Gene Roddenberry's Adromeda. We never got to see it here. I have watched Farscape, that was made here, oh, so was above and beyond ( that we never got to see here). But now we get to see V again. I""d like to see the wheel of time( by Robert Jordan) or Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson or some science fiction that makes sense."
"with a 8.9 rating at the writing of the comment I would think this this movie would have to be something of a revolution. Alas , how far from the truth. The technological innovation in CGI makes Pandora no more real than Discovery channel documentaries. And a predictable pedantic storyline just does not go down my throat. This is a must watch movie just for the CGI. Nothing more , nothing less.More over there is nearly nonexistent acting. The characters are cardboard cutouts.All of the characters either murderous villains or sacrificing angels.More suited for a Disney family movie. It is neither the movie of the decade or anything. Hell it will struggle to be movie of the year."
"The hype I had for this film was unbelievable, I couldn't believe when I got up today that I was actually going to see it. Got back home, sat on the sofa and was heartbroken by what I saw.What happened James Cameron, you used to be such a great storyteller but now you carried away by the world and technology you're creating for this film and put characters and plot on the back-burner. The characters were clichéd and stock, the plot was uninspiring and was just 'Dances with Wolves' or 'Pochantas' in space.The visual effects and James Horner's Oscar worthy score were the main redeeming factors for me. I'll admit now I watched it in 2D, I'm seeing it in 3D tomorrow (don't ask, I brought the tickets in advance but today I just went to the cinema. That might claw some things back.The only other thing I can say though is that Zoe Saldana's performance was good and 2009 has been a good year for her, out of all motion-captured performances, Na'vi and Avatars, hers had the most emotion to relate to, which if I'm honest was practically rare in this film. I'll take my hat off as well to Sigourney Weaver for having a solid performance and was genuinely sad when she died. Apart from that everyone else was sub-par.Overall the visual effects were amazing but it was let down by the uninspiring plot and underdeveloped characters.For now I'll give it 6 maybe 7, if I'm nice, out of 10 It might go up tomorrow when I watch it in 3DEDIT:Well now that I've watched it 3D I can say that its one of the most beautiful looking films I've seen, I got lost on the world of Pandora and the 3D literally added that extra depth that was missing when I first watched it in 2D. The only way you can experience this film is to watch in 3D, they shouldn't have released it in 2D at all.My original opinion still stands on the plot and characters, but getting over what I didn't like and watched it for what it was I found it highly enjoyable in many senses. Not the best film of 2009, or this decade or ever as many people are claiming, but there are far worse films out there like Transformers 2.So overall I'll give the film 6/10 but in 3D I'll give 8/10"
"James Cameron has done it again. This man has a innate talent for telling good stories, and an even better talent presenting his story with spectacular visuals accompanied by the most minute of details.While the story may seem familiar, the images aren't. Every scene, especially those of Pandora at night are just amazing and simply (no pun intended) out of this world. You just might wish there is such a place called Pandora somewhere out there.Finally, if the 3D option is available where you are, take it. Be spellbound by the breathtaking flying scenes. It may be a little clunky, but it's worth it.The show is 3 hrs long, but you won't feel a thing."
"To call Avatar schlock is to insult some of the worst movies made in recent years, of which August Rush, Flyboys, All About Steve and Star Wars Episodes I, II, III and VI flash to mind quickest, and most painfully.James Cameron's preoccupation with size can be referenced in 1997's Titanic directly from the script as well as seen in the disproportionate bulk of the ship itself; no ship that big has been built even to this day, let alone in 1908. In Avatar however, where full force machismo penile virility thrusts itself into flamboyant color-soaked vaginal tranquility, size definitely does not matter. More is decidedly less when super-massive machines and weapons assault super-massive... trees? It is so.Think Jurassic Park - or worse, Jurassic Park II or III - meets Alien II and III, meets Dances With Wolves, meets Transformers, meets Jarhead, meets Disney's Tarzan and Jane, meets Green Peace in purple humanoid Halloween costumes.Avatar's plot has such a hurried pace, jumping from one main theme to the next that only when Jake Sully, the hero investigating a native tribe, logs his daily findings into a web cam does the audience have time to reflect or even semi-disengage. Being constantly shoved from behind by the director is somewhat alleviated, however, due to the story's juvenile predictability. This allows the audience to catch up.And we see the dumbing-down of film continues, as no major plot element goes unspoken, and no subtlety is even attempted. This is cheaply accomplished by having Sully come to the planet Pandora, where this struggle for resources and land takes place, as a complete newbie to whom everything must be explained. The truth is, Cameron thinks the audience is mostly brainless and so he has to force-feed us the important parts we might otherwise miss, or cannot surmise.Every character from top to bottom has essentially zero complexity, except for the most fleeting of moments when Parker Selfridge, the big bad corporation's head bad guy, appears to have second thoughts about displacing an entire race of beings. This would have been barely interesting to say the most, but it is quickly discarded in the mad rush to the copulation scene.The acting in Avatar is so bad across the board that even Sigourney Weaver should be barred from film-making for at least 5 years.The computerized graphics are stunningly beautiful and breathtaking, with panoramic vistas beyond compare. But this is to say a race horse pumped full of the most powerful steroids runs stunningly and breathtakingly fast. Has the horse any true speed? Can it claim any honor in its victories? Avatar has no redeeming quality other than picturesque cinematography. Well, cinematography might be too strong a word; technology might be better.To sum it up, this is the worst film given the most praise I have ever seen; a super-massive disappointment."
"I saw the movie yesterday in IMAX 3D and I had great expectations. I have to say the visual effects are outstanding. From this to an outstanding movie the step is big though...There is no new story, no new ideas in the fantasy characters, no suspense in the development of the movie.So basically there are a lot of ingredients missing for a masterpiece! I think the movie does not deserve a spot in the top 250 of IMDb so I am giving it a 1 to balance out all the ""OMG the best movie of the whole Hollywood history"" kind of reviews but, to be fair, I would say a 5 is the correct vote for this movie"
"OK so everyone told you have to go see Avatar. I waited until the crowds dwindled and went to an afternoon 3d showing. I had high expectations for this film everyone said it was a cinematic masterpiece. They are partly correct it is a (piece).I have enjoyed many of Camerons films the early terminator films were great. The Abyss was also one of my favorites. I even enjoyed Titanic. Then we come to Avatar. In short I kept waiting for it to get good, and by the time it did I was so disenchanted I really didn't care. The action was anticlimactic the plot was thin and laced with political undertones ""how many films do we really need to take shots at what we are doing in countries over seas I don't go to the movies to see the news in another format I go to escape the world for a little while"" Much as we learned during the star wars prequels great special effects don't make a great movie. The actors portrayal of their characters was empty and made you feel as though you were watching any early day of filming and not a final cut. Sam Worthington was more believable as the cyborg Marcus Wright in Terminator Salvation. I enjoyed Sigourney Weavers character in Holes more than that of Grace and the General reminded me of Chip Hazard from Small Soilders. It was a huge disappointment."
"There you have it, James Cameron's first film since ""Titanic"" summed up in five words. If I was Michael Blake, I'd sue him for everything he's got. With ""Aliens"", ""Terminator 2"" and ""Titanic"", Cameron wrote characters that were able to hold their own against the special effects. In this, they are all clichés that do not say or do one original thing. In Hollywood, it's inevitable that every big star has one pet project that they absolutely have to do, and it always sucks (look up a little film called ""Heaven's Gate"" if you don't believe me). I guess this one was his.Is this film visually impressive? Yes, I'm not even going to argue that one; heck, it's a shoo-in for an Oscar (that's why it's getting a 2 rather than a 1). But Jim, can you do me a favor? Go see George Lucas and ask him about which is more important, special effects or the story and characters? But then again, if you do see him, he might just sue you for ripping off the third act of ""Return of the Jedi""."
"**may contain spoilers** OK, so I just got home from checking out the flick at the IMAX and I felt compelled to write my first review here at IMDb.Visually it was the most stunning movie I have ever seen and basically, that is where it ends.Aside from breathtaking special effects, the movie is a big pile of dog poo.First and foremost, the movie is about 1.5 hrs too long. It dragged and dragged and then dragged some more. Those fight scenes at the end were just utterly brutal.Cameron has done the same thing over and over again. There is a scene with a monster tree toppling over. Replace the tree with a big ship and you have the Titanic. I swear it was even the same background music.And lastly, the political undertones made me sick to my stomach. We all need to be green, save the planet, blah blah blah. Healthcare coverage isn't good enough to fix the guy in a wheelchair. In fact I remember a direct quote from the star of the movie in which he said, ""The sky people got rid of green in their home and they are about to do the same here"".I say go see it for an hour and then go home. I wish I would have."
"We've all seen or heard of similar story lines...quite the let down. Zero complexity in the plot. Special effects are incredible. Expect to be wowed by the effects but extremely disappointed by the plot. Those who truly know what James Cameron accomplished in making this film are those individuals who are familiar with CGI and special effects creation. The average viewer won't grasp the feat he has accomplished, but would expect the special effects to support an amazing storyline. This movie definitely disappoints...unfortunately, it will not gross what it needs to make up for the cost of creation.This film doesn't require 3D viewing in order to appreciate the effects. A standard screen will suffice - IMAX preferred for full effect of the flight scenes. A creative world is created by James Cameron with amazing creature details and botanical wonders. Again, expect to be impressed by the special effects and left empty by the plot."
"A game changer visually. This is by far the most visually pleasing movie experience of my life. From a technical point of view, this movie is perfect. However, a story cannot be carried by visual imagery alone, and aside from the visual, there are aspects of the story that are fussy at best. It's quite clear that the movie is trying to deliver a message, but at the same time I believe there are moral issues that get pushed aside and remain unanswered.There's no question that there is darkness to be found in humanity, but is there no hope? It seems that goodness was only to be found in our human heroes when they parted with their human origin. An origin the main character eventually left behind entirely, both physically and emotionally. When the humans began to destroy the home of the Na'vi, there wasn't much mercy to be found in the heart of our hero. They never even got a warning before our heroes began slaughtering them. What was the message here? I find that the movie painted a very black and white picture of the moral dilemmas humans are faced with. In this story, violence and death was both the problem and the solution."
"I saw a preview of Avatar last night in Glasgow and came out with the impression that I'd somehow seen this movie before. And I have. And so have you, in one guise or another.If you have an interest in movies then that shouldn't come as a surprise, and this isn't a complaint about lack of originality or clichéd plot devices (although there are arguments for both in this movie). There are after all only a finite number of themes on which to base a story.What I'm trying to say is that the entire movie felt like a re-tread of something that had come before - and not just in passing, or in specific moments, but the ENTIRE movie.There are very strong thematic similarities to movies like Dances With Wolves and Last Of The Mohicans that bob up to the surface in every Na'Vi scene (nomatter how much blue paint and exotic horse-things you disguise them with). Most of the human-orientated scenes unfold in the ""Company"" facilities that are clearly how the sets of Aliens would have looked had Cameron the budget and technology first time around, even down to the design of the VTOL craft and the power-loader battle suits.Most of the exploration and action sequences feel like levels from any xeno-based Xbox 360 or Playstation game of the last ten years. Even the strange connective tissue the Na'Vi use to link to the natural world around them feels awfully like a deliberate design for the licensed game adaptation.Maybe I'm being too cynical, but Cameron set the bar pretty high with his previous decade of movie making and I think I have a right to expect something a bit less generic.Where the movie excels is in the visual effects and the colour palette - I watched the preview in 3D and was really really impressed. There's nothing like it in terms of CG rendering and seamless motion capture. Avatar represents the next step up in cinematic effects, in the same way that Weta Digital showed the world how to do it with the animation of Gollum in The Two Towers.Weighing in at the best part of three hours, it felt like longer (something I never thought I'd say about a sci-fi movie) and could probably have used a few judicial cuts. There was just a touch of Tarantinism about it - i.e. self-indulgent and over-confident.Overall, I did enjoy this movie and when you watch it yourself (if you haven't already), I'm sure you'll enjoy it too.Despite all the incredible visuals, alien worlds, exotic flora and fauna and so forth, it's the strangest thing that I should leave the cinema wondering why it felt so unoriginal."
"Let's face it, the only reason people watched this was for the effects. The plot was derived from dozens of other sources, with a half-hearted environmental message tacked on to give it some semblance of worth. Unfortunately, I find the effects tacky and unimpressive (I'm more of a practical effects fan myself, so this might not matter to you), and without that to impress the audience, it's little more than a multi-million dollar Fern Gully. I'd just watch Princess Mononoke instead, it's better written, and has about the same ratio of animation to live action as this."
"To me it's appalling that there are people who dislike this movie. My only explanation is that people react at impulse against the huge publicity surrounding the movie's release. I refuse to think it's because of emptiness of heart.
This movie is one of the greatest masterpieces ever created, not only visually stunning, but the message is universal and the rendering intense. You are not only drawn into this fantastic universe, but you are also infused with a sense of guilt when you realize the movie is about you . Well the movie is a metaphor .
Still the Academy decided to give the award to a movie that praised war and destruction. Rather cynical, I think."
Predictable in the extreme. Cookie Cutter. Yawn.Just say no.
"Avatar is a science fantasy for the ages, an instant cult-classic that is endearingly beautiful in nearly any way you look at it. It visually raised the bar far, far beyond anything cinema had done prior, introducing the world's audiences to an era of virtual cinematography unparalleled to any other motion-picture period, bar none.Avatar is a philosophical film that explores the timeless notion of a higher power, and our position as the 'dominant' species. The planet of visitation known only as 'Pandora' parallels our world in many ways, the film grips the viewer and asks, ""who's really the alien? Who's really the outsider?"" it shows man as an accursed being to any place he might dare to dwell; 'Pandora's box' reflecting the human temptation of the knowledge of life and death in the world, as stated in the Bible. Illustrating the clash between low consciousness (invasion force) and high consciousness (na'vi).The plot line is simplistic, yet manages to be exemplary. It demonstrates man's often uncanny detachment from the world around him, and predisposition to subduing the earth and making it an extension of his ego, as opposed to something to harmonise with, the saying ""wealth but at what cost?"" comes to mind.The plot line follows a paraplegic marine, (Sam Worthington) who is forced to fight between this notion of harmony, and the notion of fractal greed, it turns out that his physical inhibition (paraplegia) is surpassed by joining the 'higher' consciousness through leaving his body, perhaps alluding to how spiritualism is our escape from the prison of flesh we inhabit."
"Admittedly I'm years late with a review for this but what the hell; my inspiration was recently watching other Jim Cameron classics and then remembering just how f**king HORRENDOUS this was and wondered if it was just me. When I saw it had a 7.9 average on here I simply felt compelled to add my own personal feelings on the subject, especially seeing as it's on sequel God knows what by now. Yeah OK Cameron is a director of cult classics generally but even for a commercial movie Titanic was very good, but somewhere in his hiatus he must have sold his soul. Like other excellent sci-fi directors such as Paul Verhoeven, Cameron's work was never devoid of political undertones; but, that said, they endeavoured to maintain their objectivity whilst inspiring the imagination of their viewer in order that the vision of the future laid out in the movie is plausible. This required acting skills and character development in order that it's audience relate to the experiences of it's characters. Cameron in the past packed his movies with a rich multitude of capable actors portraying fleshed out characters e.g Aliens; where the cast interacts, developing affections and animosities as the movie progresses. I feel as if I'm stating the startlingly obvious here but what the hell in a world of lies the truth is a revolutionary thing and anyone and everyone can feel the new world order agenda behind this."
"That's a lot for me to do an analysis of this movie, I saw in theaters in 2009 and I liked. By saw this movie recently with a closer look and I was surprised this movie try not to amaze the person with a story that can be guessed after the first 15 minutes. Apparently James Cameron, was more interested to build a universe in which he could launch several consecutive films and try to profit from inside and outside the theaters. The extremely limited characters in the third act, and many of them ending in a chiché outcome make the most painful experience in the final moments of the movie even worse. Only to be seen as technological curiosity, as they were the best special effects in 2009 and nothing more."
"This movie should spark our connection to Mother Earth, even if it is to show how all things a connected; everything that is in the Earth is in us, the human being, we are so much a part, yet we are hell bent on doing just the same thing the miners are doing on Pandora, ""Greed is good!"", I ask, is it? or should we say, ""We have taken so much from Mother Earth, now, what can we give back to heal the wounds man has created!Films like Avatar do indeed show mankind for what they are, well, some of us; we have watched this film 4 times at home and twice at the cinema, the common factor is greed, but as in this great film, we who care, can do our part in an ending which is epitomized in this remarkable film!"
"When I saw this film I was amazed in so many ways the storyline the special effects the characters there isn't much I can fault about this film. There is little I can say that hasn't been said already. Its one of my favourite films of all time! I watched it and re watched it so many times I have lost count it just never gets old for me. The thought, the planning the detail, so much of this film inspires me to the belief there must be life on other worlds.I like the concept that humans manage to interact with an alien race through the use of Avatars if the film were real how much R&D would be required to genetically engineer such a human / alien combination and for some of the machines just amazing."
"I'm not wont to assign a perfect score to a film, but this is one that deserves it. I've seen it four times now, and it remains a brilliant jewel of a movie. How often does a film reduce a cynical, angry adult man to a state of childlike wonder? There is nothing to criticize in this film. It is pure entertainment, a work of art. It is interesting, intelligent, fast-paced, action-filled, beautiful and enchanting. The story itself is simple: a soldier goes native and saves the locals and their world from destruction from his own kind. This story has been told before (surely); however, it has never been told like this. However, the crucial fact is that the story is set in Pandora, the ultimate alien jungle paradise. Yes, this movie is all about Pandora. Thís planet and its denizens the Na'vi are portrayed in the film with astonishing technical skill, more like technical artistry. On top of all this, the movie has a profound message about, well, mystical environmentalism. Is that completely cool or what? Really, this is perhaps the best film ever made. Cameron is a god."
"So I watched Avatar starring Sam Worthington(Terminator Salvation) as Jake Sully a Cripple who was recruited by The RDA to Fill His dead brothers shoes. Also Starring Joel David Moore(Chuck) as Dr. Norm Spellman, Giovonni Ribisi(Gangster Squad) as Parker Selfridge a Corrupt Businessman for The RDA, Also starring Stephen Lang(Conan The Barbarian) as Col. Miles Quartich a Former Solidier and The films main Villain who thinks Pandora is a Hell Hole and That it is dangerous. Michelle Rodriguez(Matchete) as Trudy Chacon a very Spunky Pilot. The film also star Sigourney Weaver(Aliens) as Botanist Dr.Grace Augustine also Featuring CCH Pounder(RoboCop 3) as Mo'at, Wes Studi(The Last Of The Mohicans) as Eytukhan, Laz Alonso(Fast & Furious) as Tsu'Tey and Starring Zoe Saldana(Star Trek) as Neytiri Jakes Lover and Warrior princess in The Omonticaya Clan. The was emotionally driven which made it so great also I really enjoyed the visuals amazing performances for also those who did the motion capture performances also I really enjoyed that there balance is the cycle of life one of the few Greenpeace film I enjoyed also I really dug it Science fiction aspect as well and to date The Na'Vi are most relatable Aliens who aren't Human but are Humanoid. Some of the aspects I didn't enjoy was the pervasive Language saying GD every time wasn't Needed also a sex scene between Jake & Neytiri was kinda awkward. spoiler I really Enjoyed the final Fight sequence Between The RDA & The Na'vi Clans it was exciting and One of the best next to To The Battle Of Yavin. Also I enjoyed Sully's and Quatritch Confrontation it was exciting also too see Jake to stand up for the Na'vi People even he was an ""Alien"" Spoiler . the amazing Direction From James Cameron(Terminator 2:Judgement Day), Great Musical Score from the Amazing James Horner(Troy) and Great Costume Design from Mayes C.Rubeo(Titanic) & Deborah Lynn Scott(Get Smart) Not as Awesome as Star Wars But definitely a Noteworthy Science Fiction film 8/10"
"Avatar has been carved into history as one of the most spectacular cinema achievements ever presented. This record-breaking film brought to us the enchanting beauty of an exotic world and gave us the magic of a Disney classic. Avatar made us dream in a way that very few pictures have ever been able to accomplish. It connected with us as an international community in a unique way, and dominated national media conversation for months surrounding its release. The 2.7 billion dollar box-office pull was the biggest in history and a statistical affirmation of the magnitude which was the 2009 Avatar phenomenon.Keeping in mind these overarching positives, I will do my best to abstain from knocking the film too hard on technicalities. Many reviewers whined that the movie gave us nothing but unoriginality and primitive 3D technology. They claimed that its box-office success was mostly the result of an overly- funded marketing campaign. Although these critiques carry truth, I believe that visually dependent films like Avatar shouldn't necessarily be studied analytically, but rather experienced. That is why we go to the movies right, to feel things? The true charm of the film wasn't in its brilliant screen writing or original concepts, but rather it is was in the wonderful sensations it evoked in us. It is a poor testament to our desensitized culture that many of us cannot enjoy a remarkable piece of art such as Avatar without an objective eye. The script followed the same predictable and cookie-cutter plot lines used in Pocahontas, Dancing With Wolves, as well too many others. None of the characters said anything unexpected or profound and in some instance appeared one-dimension. The cookie-cutter plot gave us the same old mediocre cookie we have now gotten fat off of. You know; white guy protagonist goes to live with the natives for whatever reason, gets accepted into their clan, finds an indigenous girlfriend, then finally fights back against his old white friends. The difference here however is that this cookie was covered in enough icing and drowned in enough sprinkles that it masked the familiar flavors we apparently all hate. Pardon my contradiction to popular hipster opinion, but I would say this recipe always tasted pretty good.It is certainly noteworthy that the underlying left-wing environmental messages were overpowering throughout the entirety of the movie. Seriously though did Al Gore co-write this thing or what? The message was over-simplified to the point where any preteen loser could warm up to it. It made feel like I was sitting through a middle-school science lesson again. Durrr. The negative portrayal of big business was so aggressive and anti-capitalist that it probably gave Bill O'Reilly a hernia. Nothing new for Hollywood though.The acting was good but not brilliant. One of the only stand-out performances in my opinion was by Michelle Rodriguez. Although only casted in a minor role as the tough yet compassionate helicopter pilot named Trudy Chacon, she was a compelling character. She owned the dialogue. Her confident ""don't mess with me"" attitude transitioned to a softer demeanour about half way through when she begins to empathize with the natives. Her subordination from her military duties embodied some of the major themes mentioned above. She eventually burns in a fiery helicopter wreck, but hey at least she fought for what she believed in and died for what was right... Ya ya we get it.Here are my final statements Whatever your opinions are related to this film and its enormous box-office success, it can confidently be said that Avatar fulfilled the fundamental purpose of cinema; it entertained us. I will go further and argue that it accomplished this in a timeless and spectacular manner, but of course that is for you to decide. Please do yourselves a favour and re-watch this classic, perhaps without a critical eye this time. We all need to feel like a kid every once in a while so do your best in putting your paganism an hold and enjoy one of the best escapes cinema has ever given us. Escape to Pandora."
"I've watched this film several times now trying to love it but I can't. I have watched in 3D at the cinema by the way and although that does enhance the experience, mainly via the special effects, i'm still not satisfied. Part of this reason is because of James Cameron's decision to make it a love story, I mean what the hell. He didn't have to make it a love story, this could have been a tale about what man does to nature but no he makes it a love story. Why? Even though the film made the mistake of making it a love story between different species and predictable, the worst part is that they have sex. Yes that's right sex as in a man and an alien. If they hadn't done this then I might have even loved the film, but oh well. Thpugh to be fair it does have some good qualities such as the acting, Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver stand out the most, amazing special effects and some fantastic fight scenes however they alone don't save the film. Now they are doing another 2 Avatars and then a prequel, all I can say is this: If James Cameron dares make the prequel a love story as well I will lose all respect for him. You maybe wondering why, well the reason is that it will be too similar to the first Avatar and either way personally I think it's a waste of time, if anything I think he should just acquire the rights for Jurassic Park and make the Jurassic park film he wanted to make."
"James Cameron might not be a perfect director, but this is borderline genius. The visual landscape he and his effects team created is beyond compare. I wish there was an award for the most original design, because I would give it to them for the 'ikran'. So many of the locations are breathtaking, and I'm not surprised that this generated the revenue it did. The CGI was also top-notch, which is awesome given it's fairly meager budget.Despite this movie being a fairly blatant ripoff of Pocahontas, it's a jaw-dropper. It dragged on, but it was still worth watching in full, at least once."
"No doubt that Avatar has some mind blowing and truly impressive special effects, which is about as fantastic as it gets.With the fear of getting killed now, I dare to say it anyway: Avatar has stolen 90 percent of it's story from Dances With Wolves and Pocahontas. It is the story about a soldier, who is sent to spy on the locals on the planet Pandora to learn their weaknesses, so the military can move them because their land contains valuable minerals. The soldier gets very close to the locals, gains their trust, becomes one of them, falls in love with one of them and starts to fight for them. Does it sound familiar?Though the story is embarrassing ordinary and nowhere near the Oscar material James Cameron hoped it to be, Avatar is still a joy ride from start to finish. The special effects are stunning, the actors do a good job and the film leaves you with a great feeling."
"While it is a great leap in the technological process of moving making, Avatar is an extremely overrated movie. The plot is boring, predictable and a cliché. The same can be said of the acting, except for S.Weaver's work. She is the only one who brings a little humor and humanity to the entire movie. The movie length is way too long. 40 minutes could easily be cut out of the second half. We get it - the humans have lots of weapons. We get it - good will triumph over evil. Does it take almost three hours to retell the most used plot on our planet?Time will prove that this movie is just an average movie in every way except box office receipts."
"This film is the biggest Box Office in the whole world. It is rated highly on IMDb.So this makes this film great???No, this is the most boring cheesy cliché film i have seen.The actors are not very good, not interesting, sigourney weaver is poor. The plot and the story are weak and very basicYou have a good disabled marine changing sides to the blue aliens to defend them against a bad general who wants their tree of life down so he can carry out development.It is not original there are no surprises or twists, it needed a director to make the characters intense and plot interesting.This movie is just a beautiful visual 3D film, but when you look deep in the film there is nothing there An excellent movie is Pulp Fiction, Alien, God Father, Kill Bill because these movies have great characters and a really good gripping story.Avatar fails to keep me awake, i knew the ending before it happened and was disappointedAll that glitters is not gold!i give this 1 star, like watching paint dry"
"I give the 3 out of 10 for visuals. Nothing else. I've seen it twice and the first time I was completely taken away by the visuals. James Cameron surpasses anything ever done (with the exception of maybe some Japanese videos like the Final Fantasy 7 advent Children movie).However, that's as far as I can go with being positive about the movie. Sure the actors were good and believable but the characters weren't. Usually when someone tries to make a story out of something completely overdone they at least try for some originality (this is a Pocahontas story). Even the Disney version had characters who weren't complete stereotypes. Avatar makes no attempt to be original. Cameron flaunts the fact that his only selling point is the effects. I felt it was an insult to cinema that this movie was even considered for best movie.On my second viewing of this I was bored. The shock and awe of the effects were gone and without them, this is a terrible piece of cinema. I do think people should watch this movie, if for no other reason than to get excited about what will happen when these visuals are actually matched by a good director and good story but don't go out of your way to see it."
"OK first of all let me state...James Camron has made some of the best movies of the 20th century in my opinion. Aliens, The Terminator 1 and 2 Titanic, all of which are great movies. So I'm not here to bash Camron or his work. But I was less than impressed with Avatar.Perhaps the over hyping of this movie made me watch it with higher expectations that I should have had. Perhaps impossible expectations. But none the less. One thing about this movie that irked me right away was the recycled sound effects...A movie of this SIZE and SCALE used recycled sound effects? Many of the animals encountered in this movie sound exactly like the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. The animation of everything was good...But it didn't blow me away like I hoped it would.Now the bad...The story...So unoriginal I almost couldn't stand it. It has this overwhelming ''save the earth'' message to it which I would rather not have crammed down my throat. It also reminds us that we ''Human beings'' are the aids of planet slowly and methodically killing the earth. Story alone gets a 2/10 score for me.Overall I can't rate this movie any higher than 5/10. I wish that I could. But I just wasn't as impressed by at is I felt I should have been."
"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! I guess I am one of the few people that didn't really like the movie. It was too predictable for one thing and the graphics were too cartoon-ish. I really had problems with ""floating mountains."" Even on a low gravity planet, I find that rather improbable. It seems the plants are carbon-based but never explains why the animals are semi-aquatic (breathing through gills but we see no water.) Perhaps I am to rooted to more realistic sci-fi adventures...of which there are very few. I have yet to figure out why they are blue.Mr. Cameron was able to cover the dichotomy of humans: the strength of our humanity is only matched by our incredible viciousness.On the whole, however, if one wants to get away from reality for a few hours it is worth a viewing. Don't expect anything like Space 2001 or even something like Star Wars ( I just love it when they have sound in space), but if one takes it as a pure fantasy, it is worth the watch."
"I love James Cameron, but Titanic and Aliens 2 are far better works of art.This movie felt so stiff - the storyline, the characters - even the FX wasn't that special believe it or not. The effects in 'Aliens 2' was far superior.I don't know why so many people loved this film - not sure, but I can understand the hypeIt also felt like similar movies one has seen before - I think the the lead actor did a good job of portraying a world-weary guyOverall a disappointment. Rooting for his next film!"
"Sure, it seems very realistic. Sure, a expensive film with cool helicopters, and research in inventing a whole planet with life forms. But when you play god, you cannot win. I don't know how many people described these alien designs as ""Creative"", but it's obvious that they are all blue elves with lizard tails. I actually paid $120 (15 USD) to see blue native elves with lizard tails managing to defeat technology using nothing more than spears and arrows. Got that? This is just another liberal film, and I can see how it sucks. It is simply impossible for blue elves using spears and arrows to defeat human technology. And a person sent to talk with the aliens, yet not achieving his duty and rebelling against his own kind does make me feel good. how on earth would anyone want to see his/her own race get slaughtered like that? Oh, wait, it's on a small moon. And many seemed to enjoy the fact that this film did not take advantage of 3D technology and make any ""roller coaster scenes"". I don't. 3D films exist for thrill. I don't see why only horror films and Pixar can make 3D films with thrilling moments. Anyway, see it for the technology. remember to bring ear plugs."
"***May contain spoilers*** Where to begin? Hmm. OK, well, take away the CGI from this film and there is actually very little left: hackneyed plot, average acting and some utterly cringeworthy scenes. During one scene in particular (there were blue people waving their arms around in a crowd) my girlfriend and I actually burst out laughing in the cinema. From that scene onwards, any suspension of disbelief was suspended.I was so disappointed with James Cameron after seeing this. Frankly I expect much better.This film is probably OK for young people up to the age of ~18, and perhaps adults who are a little soft-headed, the rest shouldn't waste their time."
"I am very, very disappointed with this movie. The way people talk, it was like this movie was going to change everything about movies. I guess in some ways it did, and in others it failed miserably.Let me say I've been a big fan of James Cameron until his last few movies. I grew up in the 80's, and he did change film making in the 1980's. From Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, and Terminator 2. Those movies influenced many people and movies. Sadly the last three films True Lies, Titanic and Avatar have failed or maybe succeeded. I guess it depends on your point of view. What is more important to you a good story and great acting or amazing visuals/action that will blow you away, because that will blow you away. If you are looking for the latter than this is the movie for your.I don't know what's wrong with Cameron, maybe it's the writers he has but I believe he wrote the story for all his movies. The early ones from Terminator to Terminator 2 all had interesting stories and characters and were able to blend it together with great visuals. So I don't know what's wrong with him, except maybe he's lost his touch.Oh yes the review for the movie.First of the good: Simply the visuals/action, it was absolutely amazing. The world and life he created is stunning. Do I think he will change film making with what he's done with this heck yes. The world comes alive and you feel it. Sadly that's the only thing alive in this movie and leaves me thinking what could have been.Now for the bad: Story: It's absolutely terrible. It's essentially what we(The Europeans) did to the native Americans of North and South America. This story has been done many times over and much, much better. Also the anti-American/imperialism is rampant through this movie. I can understand if Cameron wanted to make some kind of statement, he just should have done a better job of it.Characters: Thanks to left-wing story, the characters are cardboard cut outs and uninteresting. From the company man who only cares about the making money and nothing else. The evil colonel who thinks the indigenous population are nothing but savages and hold no value. To the stereotypical Indians(The Na'vi). I mean some on it is down right laughable. The only characters that interested me were Trudy(Michelle Rodriguez) and Grace(Sigourney Weaver), but they were stuck to the back ground.So overall if you enjoy nothing but great action/visuals/special effects this movie is for you, but if you also enjoy a good story and interesting characters this movie isn't for you and will leave you disappointed.It left me wondering what could have been. What if this movie had a decent story interesting characters and good directing. Than I truly believe this movie would have been one for the ages and people would be talking about decades from now."
"What has become of this fascination beginning to arise throughout the audiences of the world? We seem to have become blind to the repetition of the same old story plots that have become clichés...this movie is perhaps the pivotal story of this movement The story found in Avatar has become a tired one...a man enters into a more primitive society than his own and learns to love it and gains the heart of the chief's daughter. As I watched the movie, I found myself expecting Grandmother Willow's face to appear in the tree of life, or for Stands with Fists to be cutting herself once again beneath the tree...heck why not just throw in Kevin Costner in for Worthington's role instead? Have we become blind to such plots directors use over and over again, thinking we are too ignorant to see past this guise? After one hundred years of movie going, we as a mature audience must demand for new ideas, or at least story's with a little more originality. No amount of million dollar computer graphics should be able to buy our demand for originality..."
"James Cameron did an amazing job with the production of Avatar. From the mind blowing visuals to the ability for the film to really capture the audience, he hit the nail right on the head. The story begins with a marine brother fulfilling his recently deceased brother's duty: To travel to Pandora on a mission. Jake Sully is a relatively closed off individual, but quickly changes as he dives deeper and deeper into the realms of Pandora. The exceptional visuals of the film are what initially grip the viewer's attention and from that point on, they never let go. As the plot develops, the viewer seems to grow closer and closer to the characters. At some points in the movie I felt like I was a part of the world, and actually cared about the outcome of the movie.Overall Avatar does an exceptional job of telling a story (which many people argue is quite similar to past films/stories) while entertaining the audience with amazing special effects and visuals.I would recommend this movie to any and all people who wish to let their mind go and really sink into Pandora. The film is very well made and is very hard not to like. James Cameron did a great job making this terrific film the very best it could be."
"Okay... let's take it from the top.The movie opens with some fairly direct and uninspiring narration. (Cliche count: 1) An ex-marine who's lost the use of his legs, and his twin brother, get sent to another planet for a fresh start. The planet Pandora contains some incredibly valuable resource that makes it worth the time and energy everyone expends to get there. There's an indigenous population that lives on top of a major deposit of this rare resource. (Cliche count: 2)The Avatar program puts people's minds in the bodies of half-alien, half-human hybrids to better relate to the natives. Our hero is one of these people, and instantly goes bonkers-happy at being able to use his legs again. (Cliche count: 3)The other characters include a nerdy little buddy who's excited about everything. (Cliche count: 4) The base commander, who's an irrepressible douche because he's a hardened marine with no emotion. (Cliche count: 5) There's lead scientist lady who's a bitch outwardly, but a bleeding-heart liberal inwardly. Not sure that's a cliché yet, so we'll let that slide. There's the hot, tough fighter pilot chick who says stuff like ""five by five"" and shows off cleavage at every possible opportunity. (Cliche count: 6)Now here's where the movie really gets moving. Our hero, in his Avatar body, stumbles across a great big monster that makes him run away and get lost in the jungle. (Cliche count: 7) Where he is alone, unarmed, and is being watched by the natives. One of them takes aim at him with a bow and arrow, but decides to spare his life because a dandelion puff lands on the end of her bow. So, instead, she saves him from death, then treats him like garbage because he's an outsider who doesn't know the ways of the forest. (Cliche count: 8) She takes him back to her village. (Cliche count: 9) There, he finds out that she's the chief's daughter. (Cliche count:10) And she is next in line to be high priestess like her mother. (Cliche count:11) Her betrothed is an insufferable jackass to the outsider, and wants to kill him immediately, (Cliche count:12) but her mother intercedes and says that she must show him the ways of the tribe so he will understand them better. (Cliche count:13)Well, when our hero wakes up, the General wants him to use his in to get Intel, the scientists want him to use his in to improve relations, and the annoying, one-dimensional corporate ass who runs the operation wants to just bulldoze the natives to grab his valuable rocks. (Cliche count: 14)Ooookay... that takes us through the first 25 minutes. Only two hours more to go!! And it goes on like this. I invite you to watch this movie with a notepad and pen, and count the clichés. I cannot understand why this movie is so amazingly acclaimed. It it because it fills a plot we've already seem before with extraordinarily expensive, stunning visuals?Anyway, I'm gonna rush through to the end here. Hero learns the way of the tribe, recreates the fairy sex scene from Ferngully, lands the chief's daughter, then tells them they have to leave as the bulldozers are on the way, they try to kill him, the marines try to kill him, the scientists try to help him. They end up in a cell, the pilot chick busts them out, Sigourney Weaver dies. They go back to the tribe, our hero bags and tames some giant pteradactle and earns their respect enough to lead the various clans in an epic battle against the evil humans... of which, he is one.They fight. It looks pretty. The Marines lose. Our hero gets transferred into the body of his avatar permanently. He likes it. Everything works out fine for everyone...Except the human beings.My cliché counter explodes. The End."
"One hallmark of a poor movie is that the experience significantly degrades upon repeated viewings. For all the spectacular CGI, incredible scenery, and highly imaginative landscaping, the movie bores repeatedly with one movie cliché after another. Do I need to count what was stolen from The Matrix, Alien/Aliens, Dances with Wolves? Why rely on what has become known plot twists and conventions? How could Cameron recycle so many overused ideas in one movie? Sure the concept had much potential -- but with the focus on the FX, the more subtle plot details get washed out in predictability. Of course, the movie looks spectacular, especially in 3D on IMAX. The movie could have been so much more..."
"Avatar is that rare film where everything you ever hear about it is absolutely true. All the criticism is valid and all the praise is justified. It really is the sibling of James Cameron's Titanic, in that it is a very ordinary story presented in an extraordinary fashion. Your opinion of it will be determined by whether you care about what a movie has to say or how it says it.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a crippled Marine in a future where a corporation has established a mining colony on the alien world of Pandora. Jake's twin brother was part of the Avatar program, where human beings have their minds projected into genetically engineered bodies that resemble the natives of Pandora, 10 foot tall blue humanoids called the Na'vi. The idea is that by presenting themselves in similar forms, they can more successfully interact with the Na'vi. When Jake's brother dies, the wheelchair-bound Marine is offered the chance to take his place because only someone with his brother's DNA can ""drive"" his alien form.When Jake arrives on Pandora and jumps into his Na'vi body, he finds himself caught between the scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who wants Jake to help her learn about the aliens and their world, and Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who wants Jake to get him militarily useful intelligence on the Na'vi. The head of the mining colony, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) doesn't care a whit about Jake, he just wants the Na'vi to leave their homes so he can dig up a mineral called Unobtainium which is worth 20 million dollars a kilo.You may have heard Avatar described as ""Dances with Wolves in space"". Well, that's a pretty fair characterization as the rest of the movie is all about Jake becoming part of the Na'vi, learning their ways, falling in love with a female named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and eventually siding with the aliens in spectacular battle against the humans that are trying to exploit Pandora for their own needs.The computer generated images of Avatar are the most extensive and best looking stuff that's ever been on the silver screen. The scenery is incredibly detailed and realistic. The Pandoran wildlife and the Na'vi themselves are phenomenally lifelike. The advanced technology of the humans, like their Battletech-style armored suits, are more clearly defined and believably designed than anything you've seen before. And unlike some films where the CGI action sequences turn into little more than blurs of color and motion, Cameron is able to slow things down and keep things clear so you can follow what's happening in even the most dynamic moments. Watching this entire film is like the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or the morphing T-1000 from Terminator 2.Now, the verisimilitude of computerized special effects doesn't really blow me away. I certainly enjoyed looking at Avatar, but I generally need more than that and I just barely got it from this movie. This is an extremely formulaic and pedestrian story. There's nothing boring or stupid about it and if you took away all the CGI effects, this script wouldn't have made a bad film. It just wouldn't have ever been made into a film because there's nothing interesting or compelling about the tale Cameron has written. In fact, there are a couple of points where it seems like Cameron deliberately avoided more complex and potentially engaging story possibilities. I'm not sure if he wanted to keep the story as dumbed down as possible or if he simply focused too much on the special effects, but this is probably the least dramatically ambitious tale Cameron has ever told.Avatar is a fun, exciting film to watch. I can recommend it with no reservationsbut unless you're obsessed with the latest advances in CGI technology, I can't really call it a ""must see""."
"During the first half of the film we are introduced into the marvelous and alien world of Pandora. Special effects are top flight and oonceptual science fiction elements are tightly woven.Alas this marvelous setting is squandered on some kind of wacky morality play in which evil humans driven by overbearing caricatures of the military and corporate worlds act like monsters to destroy the hippie wonderland.The whole second half is boring and rather predictable, although I'll admit I never thought it could plunge to this level of crude self=satire. By the end I was reminded of Sigourney Weaver's plan to ""nuke the place from orbit"", just to rid of these ridiculous stereotypic Natives being saved by the Great White Hunter and his renegade sidekicks.There is no subtlety at all in the second half morality play. We are being force fed a phony morality until it is reborn in a massive episode of projectile vomitus of hovercraft brought down by pterodactyls. Enough. The beautiful people with their private jets and hundred million dollar self aggrandizing lectures don't expect to have to live in the jungle. They expect us to live their, in obeisance to their Angry God of Carbon.Way to ruin what could have been a very good movie."
"I thought Avatar was a great visual experience and James Cameron really should be commended for all the excellent advancements he has made in CGI special effects film making here. But I thought the story was very thin on plot and really huge parts of it, all the broad strokes of the story, are very much recycled from other movies. From Pocahontas to Ferngully, a lot of children's movies have already explored the we're-the-invading-army-displacing- good-hearted-natives plot line. Why revisit this same story again? The effects make the movie worth seeing in the theatre as long as all you are looking for is fantastically advanced 3D spectacle, it's all visuals and not much on story. The acting is okay, could have used more Sigourney Weaver and it's hard to tell how good the acting is through CGI characters anyway. I can't stand Giovanni Ribisi in most of his roles and this is no exception, he annoyed me every time he was on screen."
"An open note to those who helped make this film:For God's sake, why won't you Hollywood execs pay for a writer?? It seems like a good plot is harder to come by than unobtanium. For all the time, money, and effort that went into this film, the best you could come up with for a story was 'orphan outsider joins harmonious natives against rainforest bulldozers'? Really? Gee, I've never seen that movie before. Thanks.Even the much-lauded special effects were disappointing at best. Granted, a lot of work went into making beautiful scenery, but it's nothing that hasn't been seen in video games for over a decade. Where was the wind, the rain, the storms, the extreme temperate zones that all planets have? Even Fantasy Island had bad weather. As for the character animation - again, OK, it was very nice, but Pixar has been doing better, more creative, and ultimately more believable work for 15 years. (In both cases, nothing against the animators, just the material they were given.)This film is a marvel of marketing and flash-and-glitter, and an unbelievable waste of work and money. And with all the terrific and original stories out there that could be made into great films, this one is nothing less than a shame.Fortunately, Avatar will be forgotten in a few short years. Unfortunately, those of you who shaped it will never understand why."
"If this movie came out maybe twenty-years ago it would have been fine, in fact it may have become my favourite. However, I am one of those people who if I see the same film too often, whether I like the film or not, I will get sick of it and never wish to view it again. That goes for this film, I was sick of it way before I even saw it. How is that possible? Well, I think anyone else who has seen Avatar would know the answer to that; because the story has been used one thousand times already! Anyone who can't see this exact story in at least three other films really hasn't watched many movies before. C'mon! The only thing that they changed was the genre, but the things that made the film Science Fiction have also all been plucked from something else. I find it virtually impossible searching for anything original that can be found in Avatar. Then again, I suppose I can just not watch any other film for the next fifty years and then watch Avatar again. Maybe I won't be sick of it anymore."
"OK first of all, people seem to be rating not the film, but its special effects and 3D. Its got outstanding visual effects and ill give it that but, that's it. Nothing much more. Its a over used, tired, old, basic action movie plot that has been used more times than my mothers hair brush. Crippled guy (boohoo) meets hot woman but something keeps them apart (in this case its cos ones a 10 foot tall Smurf), and there is a whole war going on in the background. Doesn't that sound familiar? * COUGH* Pocahontas * COUGH*OK you know what this would be good as. A game, but they made one of it, and it sucked :| (suffered from cash cow movie tie in game syndrome).Really it looks nice on the top but when you dive down deeper you only find a bland over used core.3/10"
"I remember when this movie first came out in the cinemas (theaters). I thought it was just going to be one of them action movies with no really good plot.....But I was wrong.Now, normally when I watch movies, I never really look at who the director is of the movie, but since I have just started wanting too be a film maker, I have noticed that a lot of good films like 'Aliens' and 'Terminator' have been made by James Cameron and Avatar is one of his movies.Anyway, back to Avatar. If you haven't seen this movie, go and buy or rent it. It is a great film. It has a lot of great action in it, but it also has a great plot. I won't give any spoilers about it, but it is definitely worth watching. I kick myself for not going to see it in the cinemas. I love the movie! I give it a 9/10.GO WATCH IT!!!!!"
"They say you get what you deserve, and I think the success of Avatar is indicative of Hollywood's opinion of the average film-goer. Sure the special effects are spectacular and the planet setting is beautifully realized, but in terms of narrative and character strength, the film is sadly lacking. Coupled with it's heavy handed message, for me it perfectly represents Hollywood's feeling about it audience: if we whack enough bells and whistles on it and build up enough hype, they'll come. I like to think that today's audience is more sophisticated than they are given credit for. I just wish the box office figures backed me up."
"I am a 23 yr old man and I can say that I am obsessed with watching movies and am a harsh critic of most of them. However I have not seen anything like this in my entire life. Avatar is the greatest movie of all time. Have there been any other movie in the history of cinema which deals with so many humane subjects at the same time ? American Imperialism and ""Greed"" is the root of all conflicts in the 21st century. Today it is war for Oil tomorrow something else. This movie clearly reflects the political scenario of the world as to how developed countries are living as parasites on the rest of the world destroying natural resources and involving in genocide of the masses. The concept of ""Utopia"" or a perfectly balanced world where every living and non-living organism is depending on each other for survival, living in peace and harmony, which is depicted in the movie is what people universally desire. Mr Cameron you are the Da Vinci of our time."
"Basically this movie is about the visual breakthrough of cinematography, which is great in a way, BUT the plot is awful completely predictable and if your IQ is over 100 and you go through the whole movie you will get brain damage. Personally i would advise against this movie, it doesn't represent anything, it's a blah with pretty pretty colors. One of the pro's of this picture is the 3D experience aka brainwashing, sorry for that, should have been objective, but whatever. It's a shame that the human mind has become attracted to this painful- commercial production. As a conclusion i must say that this film is totally overrated, totally, totally... Get it?"
"One thing about Avatar is unconditionally true, it's a technical marvel. My mind staggers at the thought of how much creativity and hard work went into the creation of Pandora. From the plants, to the animals, to the faces of the humanoid characters, Avatar is stellar. And the way it's all integrated together with the human characters makes it even more impressive.As for the rest of the movie, it's good enough to not detract from the visuals. The story is a tried-and-true favorite. Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and the other cast members are fine, whether they're in Navi bodies or their own. My main complaint with the movie was how cartoonishly evil the main villain was. It's a bit hard for me to swallow such a 2-D antagonist, these days. Otherwise, this is a solid adventure movie with some of the prettiest computer animation that you'll ever see."
"Just as I did in Star Trek, I'm going to again single out Zoe Saldana as the one who walks off with the show. Granted this time her wonderful performance is only made possible through the truly, truly astounding work the tech guys did on bringing the Na'vi to life, but still, her character (well-written, strong, developed) is all her own. She's like a proper kick-ass, fully-formed, independent, very sexy (yes you read that right; move over Jessica Rabbit) fiery, spunky heroine, and I thought she was awesome. It's her - not Sam Worthington and her, just her - who gives the film such real heart and means the emotional stuff really does work exactly as it was intended to.In 3D IMAX the spectacle is immense. I don't quite know what I was expecting for this - my first time seeing either 3D or IMAX - but as soon as I walked in I dialled down my expectations a touch. The whole 3D thing is brilliant, and although I unfortunately had the projectionist's reflection at the extreme right of my vision, and - undoubtedly due to my somewhat poor eyesight - it occasionally became a little ""squinty"" around the edges, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not all of Pandora is photo-real (and alarmingly, not in the opening shot!) but much of it is. And I mean photo-real. The thrilling first scene set at night, with the forest illuminated only by a touch of moonlight and Jake's flaming torch is for me the technical standout (the Na'vi notwithstanding) because everything in the frame looked absolutely real, yet none of it was. At many times during the film I had no idea where to put my eyes. There was so much going on, and the screen was so big, the detail so vivid, the design so spectacular.My major fears about the content of the film itself proved unfounded. No it's not a groundbreaking plot, but the presentation makes it feel - if not new - certainly nowhere near as hackneyed as it might seem on paper. The characterisation is about what you'd expect from a film of its type, and if Sam Worthington doesn't make much of an impression as Jake, Saldana, the always-brilliant Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver all impress to one degree or another. Thanks to the technical achievements the plight of the Na'vi is often heartbreaking. They're big blue aliens but before long they were as real to me as anything else. Once key scene where they're subjected to a horrendous attack seems to last forever, and is a forceful and tragic piece of cinema the likes of which modern Hollywood event pictures never see. This was the part where I was closest to welling up, although there was a touch of that kind of thing towards the end.The Iraq/Afghanistan allusions (is that the right word?) are blatant; impossible to miss. I personally don't think that counts as heavy-handed though, not in this kind of film. Cameron's not making an allegory here, he's not making a political point, he's not even asking us to think. He's merely saying ""What happens on Pandora has many similarities to what's happening in Iraq and Afghanistan"" and nothing more.The action sequences are spaced out nicely and none of them outstay their welcome as is almost always the case in my opinion. They're approached in the same visionary manner as everything else that even the familiar seems fresh. The final battle was awesome (even if Jake's pathetic rallying speech before it was a shocking damp squib.) The humour - all of it - works.The score is good, but it blatantly rips off Enemy at the Gates at one point, and Aliens in another.I have a feeling this rating will go down on subsequent viewings, but as it stands now I can't find significant fault with it; its strengths and achievements tower over and so thoroughly dominate what weaknesses it may have; and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this excited about a film after I've seen it that it's top marks from me.The sheer magnitude of that scene where they're destroying Hometree was staggering. I thought, They're not going to nuke it? Well then how will they destroy something that huge? Then the ships lined up and started a very familiar, almost mundane pounding. And pounding. And I realised that's how they were going to do it. Endless waves of artillery. They're just going to keep chipping away at this noble tree with their ignoble weapons until it falls. That was all just tragic to me. It's a testament to the writing, the acting and the CGI that this destruction felt so... wrong.I loved Jake fending off the ""dogs"" before he meets Netiri. As great as anything I've seen in recent sci-fi. Loved the design of everything, especially inside Hometree with the vines. That exhilarating ride/climb/jump (!!!) up to the Hallelujah Mountains was another standout moment; in fact the whole sequence was. As they leapt from the tip of that vine my heart jumped into my throat along with them. Later when Jake's wrestling that banshee and he slips over the edge I had a similar reaction. Breathtaking stuff.It's rare these days to get a proper, honest-to-goodness look at something (Quantum of Solace, Transformers step forward) but Cameron's eye is so keen that he's confident enough in everything to put it all up there on the screen. Ebert was right about the way he spent the money. Every penny is up there, without question."
"Wow, Wow and Wow is all I can say about this film. James Cameron's best film by far, Titanic is a very good film and obviously based on a true story, as far as Avatar ""this is a mix of sci-fi fantasy"" which is totally not something I would get into but their are some great aspects that you can relate too in the way the world is today and what counts and matters to people, greed, power etc.I will say I love the cast in this movie I first saw Sam Worthington in ""Rogue"" Greg Mclean's Aussie Crocidile film, he had a small part but I knew he was going to do big things, when you put him alongside Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Giovanni Ribisi your bound to see a great picture. This movie is the most intensely colorful film I have seen in my life, makes you feel like you are their, the acting is very good my only slight criticism is that it's a little cliché, but now days what isn't?? It's one of the most original stories I have ever had the pleasure of seeing been played out on a big screen! It's one of those movies you just don't want to end, the fact that anyone can view any part of this film as boring or dull baffles me!! It really is one of the best films in movie history no need to say anymore, grab your copy on DVD or even Blu-Ray if you can you will NOT be disappointed."
"This has got to be one of the best movies of all time.The thought and detail behind this visual spectacle of a foreign planet with different animals, plants and inhabitants is spellbinding enough. The story too is gripping and although it is fairly 'simple' (i.e. it is a love story after all with no big twists - which are completely unnecessary here) it flows nicely and is given time to develop.I was absolutely absorbed and the time of the movie flew by as I was immersed into a beautiful fantasy. I watched the movie on the big screen twice as a result (which has only happened on one other occasion with T2 a good number of years back).Although this movie is not for everyone (i.e. if you hate fantasy), there is no denying that the detail and concept is incredible."
"I don't think I have come out of a cinema screening more blown away from any movie I've ever seen than I have when I saw Avatar at the cinema. No doubt as far as special effects are concerned, this is a landmark in cinema history. There is no surprise that this is currently the highest- grossing movie of all time in the box office. James Cameron has captured the movie in such breathtaking fashion, and special effects aside, the storyline will have you glued to the screen and the love story between Jake Sully and Neytriyi will be romantic for those who are watching that are on a date. This movie has everything, it delivers everything, and with the sequel coming up, I think we could yet again be in for a treat!"
"(note:I first saw this just a few days after its release, and I purposely waited in the case that it won Best Picture. Unfortunately it was overlooked by the Academy.) For a bit over a year now, I have become a James Cameron fan. I was blown away by Aliens, and I felt that The Terminator and T2 were also quality science fiction films. And then I finally saw Titanic thinking that it was just going to be overrated and boring. I was proved dead wrong. And then I saw The Abyss and True Lies and enjoyed those as well. Half a year later, Avatar finally comes out and although it looks like it could be amazing, there's no way that it could be better some of the best Cameron films.As I expected, I was blown away, but far more than I expected to be. It wasn't quite the film it might be. It was far deeper and less simple minded than critics were making it out to be.Of course everybody knows the plot. I knew it a while before it came out. In 2154, crippled marine Jake Sully goes to the world of Pandora to be involved in the Avatar project. The purpose of Avatars is that they are human brain-controlled vessels that have the body of the native species, the Na'vi. The humans are mining Pandora for a valuable substance known as unobtanium. They want Jake to gain their trust, so that he can find out about the planets largest stores of it. In the planet's lush forests, he finds a Na'vi princess named Neytiri, who dislikes him at first for what the humans have been doing to the planet, but soon discovers that he is much more than they are, just as Jake finds more in the Na'vi than he would at face-value.Simple plot, yes. However, a part of what makes a movie good is how it's presented. On paper the story would look very weak. But mixed with the visuals, the movie is given more power and depth than most of the CGI-based blockbusters in recent years. If it were just visuals and no story, then it would just be the mess that is a film like Transformers 2."
"First of all, I did not regret to have seen this movie. I loved the colors and visual effects. But it is all too much. It lacks any subtlety. In every corner of the movie there are effects. It gives me the same feeling as the Starwar movies. It is all too much a computer game, no rest no time to breath. I think it is beautiful in the light of the zap-culture. The only thing that grabbed me were the visual effects. But one and a half hour should have been enough for me. I can imagine that for instance that the movies Solaris , I am legend, 2001 a space odyssey, planet of the apes in 3D have more effect to me. They contain a story-line and some mystery"
"I had waited about 3 weeks after it's release to see the movie. I went into it hoping to see a great story with visually stunning effects. I walked feeling like I had already seen the movie before and was less than impressed with it's special effects.The 3-D effects were much less than I had hoped for. I had seen 3-D movies in the past and was hoping to see more than bugs flying past me. Great idea, just poor application.The story: What can I say? I kept waiting for Pocahontas to go by in a canoe at any point sing ""Colors of the Wind"". Disney's Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai, Avatar. They all have the same story line. So by midway through the movie I couldn't wait for the movie to end. It became overwhelmingly predictable and boring.Unfortunate, because of the possibilities that this movie could have been, it turned out to be nothing more than an over-produced Disney rip-off."
"The 3D is very clever, the CGI very pretty. But isn't a move actually about telling a story?Avatar is indeed a film that could not have been made without 3D... because no-one would have watched it. Once you get past the pretty packaging what is left if possibly the most unoriginal, dull (yes dull), uninspiring, predictable film I have seen in years. I was bored. Once you have got used to the eye candy, its dull. Take the standard plot from 100 cowboy and Indian films, add in the stereotypes from any Vietnam films (ideally the worst ones), dust down with some eco-greenery, and round off with any random action sequence to finish the film off. As a bonus add in the most unappealing, annoying ""hero"" you can imagine and you have Avatar. Really.Its also a film whose plot makes no sense in so many ways. They are there to get hold of a mineral with a truly silly name whose purpose is never explained. They do not give a hoot for the indigenous wildlife and inhabitants. So why the crazy science stuff - if its so vital surely your stereotypical super-ruthless marine colonel would nuke the place from orbit, then take it? No - instead he flies in using helicopters - very 26th century, even my 13 year old son couldn't understand that one. All that was missing was a few comments concerning the pre-breakfast smell of napalm.The plot holes are many, and Ms Weaver is still playing the same part she played in Alien - just worse - but its still probably the most rounded, convincing performance from any actor. There is a certain irony about a 3D film having such 1D acting.The shocking thing, though, is that so many people are taken in by this dross - that does not bode well for the future of Hollywood films."
"Avatar 3D is a movie with flat,binary characters, a boring story, ""lendings"" from Hayao Miyazaki (mega-trees, flying mountains, empathic bindings to animals, anyone?), a forest you cant hear because the films music is hysterically applying pathos by the bucket, at least three totally previsible ""climaxes"" you know will happen eventually because they always do and graphics strangely attached to a 2D world (lens focus in a 3D environment???) It still looks like very good computer game graphics to me, despite all the cg advances, and if eye-candy and popcorn is all you want, by all means go see it. otherwise, do not expect a breakthrough but rather a modern Disney-alike serving of three ""for all the family"" hours."
"OK, so after the hype for this movie I couldn't wait to see it. Well I saw it and I can say that it wasn't such a bad movie, but I've seen better. The special effects were excellent, the acting not so excellent. Sometimes it seemed that the Avatars acting was more realistic than the actors themselves. The story was pretty nice though, although it does seem to relate with Dances with the wolves, except on another planet. But for a movie that took a very long time to film it wasn't as good as I expected it. However I do recommend this film if you are a sci-fi fan. Please don't take me the wrong way, I did like this film, Michele Rodriguez was hot. All I can say is watch the movie and see for yourselves."
"Okay, so, how is this movie any different from Battle for Terra? Both films are essentially the same in their plot and development. There are only a few minor differences. In the end, the only reason to watch the film is for the special effects. Not that that's a bad reason. Special effects are the only reason for watching a lot of movies, but it's certainly no reason to give it Oscar-worthy praise. It's almost the same story as Battle for Terra! Not to mention its similarities with so many other colonialist/imperialist films.Second, doesn't it seem weird to anyone that the non-humans are predominantly played by non-whites? Okay, so it's another commentary on colonialism/imperialism, but why does this always have to pin evil on the white race and place non-whites in the category of Orientalism. Not to say that Edward Said was incorrect, but these stereotypes in films continue to subject races to categories of Otherness that we will never overcome."
"I saw this movie in 3D and I must say, it was amazing! Visually, that is. Other then that I'm far from impressed. If you take the visual away all you are left with is a predictable shallow story with one cliché after the other. As it is a James Cameron movie, I guess one could have figured that out right from the beginning. How ever, if you want to be visually amazed and can turn of your brain for around 2 hours you should go see this movie at the cinemas, in 3D. The guys who are responsible for the visual really deserve an applaud, and once you are done applauding and you might want a laughter or two, look around you and you'll see all these mutts (just like you) with these Buddy Holly-3 D glasses...now THAT is entertainment!"
"I really don't see the big deal. I saw it, it was a movie. Maybe I am just not that impressed by special effects? Maybe my theater needed better surround sound? It was an enjoyable movie for a watch-through, but I sure would skip over it if there were anything better on.Here's what I liked: - New 3-D graphics technology: Can't fault it there, this could be a revolution. - Thematic elements: I was surprised about the kind of themes contained in this story. There's a lot of metaphors for different kinds of networks and connectivity (mind-body, man-nature, man-man, etc). I thought the various parallel metaphors were well executed. - Weaver's character: Since she's the only non-stock character, she deserves some notice. Without her, there'd be no creativity in character development at all.Here's what I disliked: - The characters: It's like a grab-bag of junky, bland stereotypes. I felt like I was watching a very-well cleaned up version of a child's attempt to make a story by combining characters from their other favorite stories. Angry drill sarge type? Got one. Naive but well intentioned guy who redefines himself as a native? Definitely. Native girl that's got a thing for foreigners? Surely. What a waste of screen time. - The plot: Seriously. I don't want to give anything away, but if you at any point lose your immersion in this movie and get a single chance to think about what's going on, it's like your beer goggles wearing off in a Coyote Ugly situation. Just rationally and logistically, there are so many things wrong with the whole setup. - Bland, bad dialog: Completely unquotable, unfunny, uninteresting.Also, the highlighted review I saw mentioned that I shouldn't expect much out of the plot and characters because it was a Cameron flick. That's completely false. Both Terminators had serious character development, in a unique environment. Aliens 2 was full of interesting characters who were consistently funny and fresh (""Look pal, I don't know if you've been keeping up with current events, but we just got our ***es kicked."") All of this was missing from Avatar....Which is not a bad movie. It's just not a very good one. And could have been much better."
"Just finished watching the 3-d version of this as I wouldn't recommend experiencing Avatar any other way. I'm sure there has been much mentioned in previous reviews about Avatar in its strengths and weaknesses but here is what I got out of it.As far as appearances go, this movie is great to look at, everything seems immaculate in its detail. Some of the creatures seem very real in some of the close up shots. The character played by Sam Worthington is the protagonist I can root for as the wheel chair bound hero turned Nav'i. The monsters were biologically creative with their telepathically physical qualities. It felt like an adventure ride from start to finish. I especially liked the beginning in the space ship where the troops were floating in space. The story, while rumored to be plagiarizing, seems forgivable, though months behind District 9, and Surrogates (a movie I didn't like too much). There were some implementations.Aside from the seemingly clichéd story, I had trouble with some of the vast amount of expositions that made the story way too predictable. The writing needed to be tweaked in order to sway from the dangerously predictable clichés in Avatar. Mentioned was a dragon head that only 5 members of the Nav'i tribe was able to conquer and tame throughout history, I found myself thinking: lemme guess, Worthington's character will probably take the saddle of this ""dragon"" later on in the film, and you know what? I was right. Then there was that pointless group-gathering montage, as if the Nav'i from the rest of the planet didn't know that their sacred tree was fallen. I felt that part should have been eliminated too. Then there was that general, while good at his part, seemed like he was all over the place as his character is spread too thin. The general stands watch in the middle of the night, holds meetings, makes strange brainwashed Marine dialog and fights in mech suits. He would have been a better right hand man, not necessarily a colonial or presidential leader. He was over utilized as a universal bad guy which got annoying.If you think these are major gripes, they are not really. This movie is still ""all sorts of awesome"" and I will be sure to own the DVD when it comes out. I still recommend it, outstanding visuals will make the story forgivable."
"I'll admit that I was expecting a lot from this movie. I had heard about the huge budget and effort required to create it and had heard that it was a landmark movie that was going to take the movie business to a new level. I didn't like the movie at all. It was a trite straightforward drama with colorless characters, recycled elements, WOW factors we've seen before and a weak ""showdown"" climax.Ground breaking CGI: Big deal. I don't know about 10 year old kids, but I've seen so much CGI, for so long, that it's simply boring. Yes the glowing flowers and such were beautiful (even if the dandelion seeds were overused), but so what? Movies are best about things in our real world, like courage, loyalty and friendship. Glowing flowers are nice but can't carry a movie.Too many recycled elements from Aliens, Terminator, Star Wars, and Transformers: Weaver, cybersleep, the loaders, the veloci-copters, the gunship, the flight deck, the pilot, the sarge, the combat drop, the walkers (Star Wars). Even the guy that can't walk now being able to walk is from ""Lost."" Trite, straightforward and pretty ham-handed drama of the military guy against the ethical soldier against the scientists against the natives...Universal Soldier (Van Damme), Soldier (Kurt Russell).Avatar concept is old, and even more so now that that concept is recycled into the virtual reality gimmick: Sargon controlling Kirk, Kirk exchanging minds with that crazy lady that wanted to be Captain, Spock's Brain (where his body was controlled by a remote control), The Matrix.Weaver's character was a waste - she did not play a big part in the story and the part that she did play was sketchy. Weaver had been there how many years? Teaching them English? And she's still there leading the team even though the military is there moving? And the natives still accept her? Weaver is all hostile to the new guy right up until she puts him in the mind link chamber. Then they meet up on the other side and she's all smiles and charm towards him. Huh? The climactic battle was a lot like the Ewoks against the Empire in ""Return of the Jedi,"" right down to the grenades in the engines.The big revelation in the movie of the neural network of the trees fell totally flat. That was supposed to be a big dramatic moment but I think everyone in the audience, just like those on the command deck were like: ""So what? Is that supposed to mean something?"" There were only a few lines in the movie that supported that plot line and after the big revelation it was pretty much dropped.Characters were not colorful and well differentiated like in Aliens (All the characters were colorless: The wheelchair guy, his buddy, Weaver, the traitorous pilot, the native mother and father had extremely small parts, the native prince was colorless, even the princess was pretty colorless, the pencil pusher heartless bureaucrat, the Colonel was the only character that was almost good), there was no sparkling dialog like all throughout Aliens.It seems that some of the ""Wow factor"" of the movie was contained in the computer displays in the lab, especially the ones that could be swiped off the wall and onto a tablet PC. If they thought that would impress me....oh please. Spielberg already tried all that exact same stuff in ""Minority Report"" to equally unimpressive results and Cameron, of all people, should know that no matter how impressive your production is, it's useless without a great drama with all of the elements needed to make drama great."
"Spoilers: I don't think it is a copy of Dances with Wolves / Last Samurai so much, I think that is missing the essence of this film... I think the movies it is actually most similar to are some of Hideo Miyazaki's movies, I think if anything, James Cameron borrowed most from Miyazai animations like Princess Mononoke (the man vs. nature, technology and industry vs. the magical wilderness theme, love between the main characters, a woman from nature, and the man who is from the mankind society, but is caught in between the two worlds, giant forest creatures, the spirit of the forest, the nighttime glowing creatures, giant wolf steed, etc.) Other Miyazaki films that this movie is borrowing from: My Neighbour Totoro, the environmental theme, the Giant Tree in the forest... Nausicaa, similar to Princess Mononoke, same themes but slightly more futuristic I think, imagery etc... Man vs. Nature, etc...It may be a bit predictable but it's visually stunning. The night scenes in the forest which are illuminated by the glowing vegitation, the floating rocks and spirit trees / big glowing willows and seed things... Flying scenes on those creatures, the big battle at the end... While I think the graphics are not spectacular, they are impressive due to the cinematic fluidity. I think what people are impressed with, and what people mean by the realism, isn't the still images, it's the organic feel of the action, movement of the camera as for example we dive in the flight scenes, etc. Cameron knows how to tell a story visually...I think it's a great movie... I don't think it deserves a 10 out of 10, that's a bit much, but it's probably an 8... Visually stunning, creates a world that the viewer can be immersed in... I understand where some of the critics are coming from, saying this is not THAAT good, not THAAT creative or original etc... But common, there is no way that this movie should be getting 1 star...rue the story wasn't that original, but then, what is? I don't know, I am not hailing this as the holy grail of movies, but it is certainly at least a 7 or 8. I think people are overreacting either way because when something is too successful, you get cynics and fanboys. Reality is, who cares about that... Go in without preconception or expectations, and just enjoy the movie! (IN 3D)"
"This movie was a total waste of my time. I mean yeah, 3D and all was nice. It looked ""pretty"" all right. But the storyline sucked.The story: O.k. lets see a totally clumsy marine almost gets himself killed by some really mean creatures in the forest. Then tribe girl comes along and saves him, tribe girl can't stand him but then miraculously falls in love with him. How original. He betrays her and her tribe, but then makes up for it by riding a huge bird thingy. (Well, I guess size does matter.) She is hooked again, and the rest of the tribe thinks he's a hero. Meanwhile some mean military people (a.k.a. sky people) are trying to destroy the tree in which the tribe people live in, just to get to the ""unobtanium"". Yeah, really. Its words like ""sky people"" and ""unobtainium"" that really slapped creativity in the face."
"What a waste of time. This is the most primitive movie I have seen in a while. There is absolutely no story, no new ideas, no acting, no suspense - something one would expect from a big sci-fi movie. The whole movie could be summarized in two sentences. Characters are very simple, the dialogue is on the level of a five year old child. Nothing but special effects and I am puzzled why people so amazed by the CG effects. Natives seem completely unrealistic to me. Not sure why they had to wait 10 years to create this level of computer animation. I guess see this movie for its 3D effects, otherwise it has absolutely nothing to offer."
"This is an expensively made but dreadful film. It feels like sitting through 2 hours of a visually fine computer game. As many have already said, the plot is a rehash of Dances With Wolves (among many others). The ending is predictable from halfway through the movie and, because this is a Hollywood film we inevitably sit through a noisy battle climax in which the baddies are gradually wiped out till only the chief baddie is left for hand-to-hand combat with the chief goodie. Yawn.The many monsters that pop up as computer animations ad nauseum are consistently reminiscent of the earlier creations of the marvellous Ray Harryhausen and are used in much the same way: either in combat with the blue or white bipeds or as allies in the form of flying or galloping mounts.Unless you have a major cerebral dysfunction common to the producers of Avatar's cretinous plot (the main complaint about the film is that at root it's just plain dumb!) you'll need to look out for the many sources of unintentional amusement. Enjoy Sigourney Weaver's avatar's curious two-piece beach outfit, which stands out ridiculously against the other bare-breasted, loinclothed females, presumably because this actress refused to work topless. (The toplessness seems curiously gratuitous anyway.) Enjoy the countless continuity lapses and scientific idiocies (two helicopter props rotating on the same shaft will counteract each other's thrust: duh!). Think about what it would really take to transport the endless huge machines and other installations to another planet.If, at the moment you see the trolleys of bombs being loaded on the main aircraft, you briefly think it's a cargo of beer cans, you'll probably share my view of this film. In a year or two it will take its rightful place as an expensive movie curiosity. Meanwhile it will continue to be regarded as a wonderful experience by those too young to have watched anything other than similar computerized shoot-em-ups animated with less gloss and panache."
"A total waste of time. Don't be fooled by the ratings on IMDb. I guess there is a media campaign from Cameron camp to promote this dumb movie, if you can call it one.CGI is a tool to make better movies, not a movie unto itself. And the faster any director realizes this, the better. I cannot think of a reason why such flimsy piece of film making would take 10 years. Except that it is a media stunt of promotion. The story line is pretty simple. Bad guys want to invade a planet and send in a Trojan. This character is expected to bring in information which will help to minimize casualties in case of war. The Trojan succeeds in the mission but in the mean time falls in love with an indigenous girl and rest of the story revolves around how the invader is destroyed. If you think terminator 4 was a disaster, this narration will leave you dumb struck and angry. Believe me and lose this movie. Its not worth it."
"It was a cheap thrill at best. The subtle racist undertones made me cringe all the way through the movie; especially the acceptance of the ""blue monkeys"" phrase. What was this film about? Simply the ""white man"" gets rich off a peaceful indigenous race by deceit and a few ""normal"" humans assimilate the ""enemy"" and succeed. The fairytale story was too much to take and the raving about the CGI: I have seen better CGI on YouTube! Nothing about this film was good, the fighting was derivative, the dialogue was predictive and boring and the acting was ridiculously bad! There was no emotion in Sam Worthington and too much emotion shown from Zoe Saldana, another subtle undertone? It felt like an, us and them, propaganda movie like 300. I would advise any intelligent person to not waste their money on this, but no doubt this film will continue to climb the ranks and end up in a position that it does not deserve."
I can tell you that this is THE BESTT movie i have ever watched i watched it for like 10 times and i cant wait till avatar 2 and 3 comes out.
"If there was the option to rate this a zero, I would've done it in a heartbeat. From the very first minute of the movie I was bored. I've sat through plenty of crappy openings, eager to see if the movies that had them got any better as the story progressed. This one just proved my intuition right; it was going to be a big fat load of (enter offensive term). Avatar was the most boring and overrated movie I'd ever seen. I literally couldn't keep my eyes open towards the end, and I was watching it during the day. Just for the record, I am incapable of sleeping when it's daytime. To quote Chris O'Dowd, ""They bomb a tree for like an hour"". With or without 3D, this is a terrible movie (unobtanium, seriously?) and you should really rethink your taste in movies if you liked it. Watch it again. I dare you to stay awake."
"Few recent films have been accompanied by the hype that surrounded Avatar. Is it justified? Well, the visual effects are undeniably striking, thanks to the latest incarnation of 3D. What about the substance of the film? The plot is as trite as the visual impact is impressive. If you have seen any of the moral tales lamenting the demise of the Noble Savage in harmony with nature, you have already heard the tale. Now let me see, what other oppressed native population rode horses, used bows and arrows, and gave 'war whoops' when riding into battle - no, don't tell me, I'm sure I'll get it. This story was told - and better told - by the 'new age' westerns of the 1950s starring the likes of Randolph Scott. The characters in Avatar don't fare well in a comparison with those earlier examples of the genre either. They are comic book figures - stereotyped, two dimensional and bordering on the infantile. This is the sort of film in which the heroes are so sickeningly sweet you find yourself rooting for the villains - at least they are more interesting! Does this film have any merit? Is it worth watching? If you are under the age of 16, the answer might be yes - otherwise, it will be an insult to your intelligence."
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen around which there has been such huge amounts of hype! A visual treat, breathtaking ride, outstanding experience- are just few of the words to describe this ordinary affair. But in many places, the movie is so stupid and cliché it makes me cringe!First of all, the insane war on the Na'avi people is so sick and reminiscent of the present situation in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan. No explanation is offered at all as to what claim the shitty military men have on the land of the original inhabitants. I mean, hello? Any body has a sane mind over here? It is just as simple as come on folks. Let us wage a war! Bullshit! Where is ethics and rationality, huh? At least give some background to the audience about how these guys are in such a delicate situation of war. It turns out materialism is all you need to go bad and bomb an entire planet which you have no right to even touch. Good job making it real, man! And all of these people are shown to be Americans? How original! Deja-vu, anyone?Then also why are the Na'avis so trusting of this odd man out Jake (in the body of a Na'avi) when they don't know anything about him? IS that really how it works in tribes? NO! Our man Jake is not even touched. On the contrary, he gets a girl to strut about the jungle with and learn their ways! Well, he will be definitely learning how to bed Na'avi chicks, that's for sure!The military guys are so one-dimensional they seem like robots bent on destroying and kabooming every thing in their way. A stupid speech is all it takes to charge up hundreds of soldiers and make them charge and fight for no reason at all apart from a singularly materialistic one! What the hell! It is their land, you suck-ups. Who gave you authority to even land on their planet? But no, no soldier thinks that apart from our dull hero (will come back to him in a moment). Everyone is just happy following the goddamn orders without a thought given to err, how is this a noble thing? Jeez!And Jake Sully- he is the shittiest marine I have ever seen! Nothing is easy for him. He can't fight, can't climb trees, can't fly properly even if he has this awesome Na'avi body! After finally, when he does learn to do some of the stuff, just like that he goes and overpowers the mightiest flying bird and flies on it to the Na'avi's amazement. Now he is the tucto or mucto-something like that and the NA'avi must listen to everything he says! Wonderful! A note to Cameron- if you want to establish a character's awesomeness, do it with a certain kind of warning- not just out of the blue. Don't expect us to believe that an a**hole tames the single bird a few actual Na'avi's ever have been able to do! Besides, I wonder if Jake ever thought of any strategy to counter the ammunition from the bad side! It is just we are from the mountains, we will be fine bullsh*t that convinced me he was a loser! Come up with some strategy, genius! Don't expect the Eywa to help you out of your sorry a**kicking...I could go on and on....CGI does not ,a movie, maketh! Remember this!"
"This film is poor because it just tries to repeat the foundations of storytelling yet without imagination: The characters are superficial (you don't know much about anyone except the hero) The bad guys are bad The good guys are good... and weak, so you suffer for them The camera angles and script do not introduce any innovation whatsoever The story is, as many already described, Pocahontas Dansing with the Wolves in a Never Ending Story.I enjoyed the richness of texture and diversity of life in the planet I waited for the end, which was sadly just as poor as the general conceptWhile enjoying the beginning and path of the hero's initiation, I then tried watching the whole movie again, yet never coming to get to the end.Very cliché, very stylish. Enjoy all you can"
"I remember when I first saw Avatar in theatres and I was totally blown away. I remember leaving the theatre just stunned at what I had just been a part of. So I decided to go back for a second viewing and thats when it all came crashing down. Apparently the first time I was just mesmerized by the special effects to truly notice to bad acting,writing and characters.This movie is about a young crippled man who is sent on an army project to leave his human body and be put into an avatar body. His avatar body is a 8 foot tall alien and soon he makes friends with other 8 foot tall aliens.When I first saw the previews for the movie I thought it was going to be so great. But with Cameron spending all his money on special effects it lacks solid writing and actors. Frankly when I found out this is going to be a saga I was not impressed I will watch the other ones with hopes that they will improve."
"James Cameron is an incredibly overrated director. ""Avatar"" is a terrible film. The story is completely unoriginal and totally ridiculous. The acting is less than stellar. The dialogue is absolutely cringe-worthy. The CGI is groundbreaking and the only reason this film ever received any praise. The film is thoroughly conventional. The script feels far more like a campy exploitation flick on Syfy rather than groundbreaking cinema.""Avatar"" absolutely did not deserve to be competing at the Academy Awards against far superior films like Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"". I absolutely hated this film!!!"
"This film is overrated, and I can't believe that it's score is in the same range as Dark City and The Man from Earth, is hardly even compares.Alright, maybe I'm biased towards my own pro-ideas rather than pro-action movie opinions, but honestly, there is little or no story to it, and the SFX really didn't impress me as much as I was told they would.How could this film get the same rating as District 9? District 9 had an innovative idea, a brilliant plot, and a truly plausible storyline. I gave this film a six only because of the SFX - the plot, to me, was quite predictable. I won't wreck it for anyone who DOES choose to see the movie, however.If you like entirely action movies, then this is for you, but if you want something with a good plot, see Dark City or District 9.I'm being critical here, but I would be less critical if this film had what it deserved, a 5 or a 6."
"Like almost everyone else alive, I was looking forward to Avatar but I wasn't going on opening day or even opening week. I waited and lucky me, when I went to see it in IMAX 3D at 10am on a Saturday morning, there weren't even 30 people in the auditorium. Clean, comfy, and quiet. Just the way I like to see my movies that I pay for. Online ticketing was trying to charge me 15 bucks plus service fee. I paid at the box office because I knew it wasn't gonna sell out like it did the night before when I really wanted to go. 9 bucks was the tally. Can't beat that.Say what you wanna say and feel how you wanna feel about me for saying what I'm about to say, but I thought the movie totally sucked! That's right, I said it. This movie might as well have been a children's book it was so fluffy. Minimal cussing (even with the military present in this flick), no non-human nudity, straightforward plot with no twists or turns, ultra predictable, monotone and unmemorable characters, borderline unrealistic war motives, pointless deaths, uncreative and fairy tale climax, and the environmental theme was thrown in your face so much that you'd think you were watching a PBS special. Special effects aside (they were top-notch), there was nothing I liked about this movie. I very rarely laughed. I don't think I did at all. Only thing that got a chuckle from a few peeps was when the antagonist said he was part of the Jarhead Clan. That's about it. It was a practically emotionless movie-going experience.I mean, come on. You turn on your own species over a girl? She gives you a piece and that's all it takes? I can see about him wanting to become one of them because of the girl and having a functional body but is he really ready to live the natural life and abandon TV, internet, and all the other wonders of human technology? Yes, the tech is a demon and it can also be a godsend. I get it. But that morality was never discussed or explored. No civilized human alive would just switch that quick. I ain't buying it. Regardless of the cost for him to get new legs, I ain't buying it. Things could have been done differently. The world they created and the creatures within it were a little too forced for my taste. Took up too much screen time that could have been devoted to adding more complexity to an otherwise oversimplified plot. The whole deal was just too textbook. No depth at all.3D effects weren't so good. All the previews before the movie were of 3D movies, all of them kid movies. I expect more from 3D. I've gotten more from 3D. Those previews and the movie didn't deliver the goods. Depth perception is altered but nothing moves beyond the four corners of the screen or comes out at you. The IMAX screen was big with a crisp, clear picture and sound. I'll give credit where it's due. But save your money and if you have to see this movie, just watch it on a regular screen for a regular price. I would tell you to just wait for it on Blu-ray and if you have a nice sized TV, just watch it that way. To me, it's not worth a penny. It's boring and not at all entertaining. The only surprises were seeing Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi. Wasn't expecting to see those two. If this movie was Rated R and more authentic, then maybe it'd be worth a whirl. But as it is, if you have the mentality of a simple-minded and impressionable 10 year old, this movie is tailor-made for you. I give it 4 out of 10 stars. I don't care how popular it is or how much money it's made and is gonna make. For me, it sucks chicken bones. A complete and total waste of time and money. I'm disappointed more than anything. I expect better from James Cameron.Even with all that said, this movie still got a round of applause when it finished. Now it joins the ranks of Equilibrium, the Godzilla teaser trailer, Spirited Away, and the first live-action Transformers movie as the only movies I've been in attendance of that have gotten some applause. Nothing happens after the credits so don't waste your time even further like I did. And when I left the auditorium, there was a long line of people waiting to get in for the next showing. Wanted to tell them so bad that the movie is a dud but everyone has their own tastes. I would have been upset even more if I had to wait in a line like that to see such a horrible movie. It only got those 4 stars from me because of the innovative special effects and Zoe Saldana's voice acting. Everything else? FAIL!"
"(www.plasticpals.com) I wasn't really sure what to expect of Avatar. I knew Cameron would deliver, but I wasn't sure in what way or to what extent. In case you're wondering, Avatar does deliver – in spades. See it as soon as possible, that's all you really need to know. Still, I feel like I owe it to the film to write a bit more. Earlier I said that Avatar always seemed like ""that movie Cameron had to finish before doing Battle Angel"". Boy was I wrong. Not that there are many bad reviews out there, but honestly those critics can go expletive deleted themselves.Avatar blew my mind. I haven't felt like this since I saw Jurassic Park as a kid, which is probably why the word ""breakthrough"" is making the rounds. This is the feeling of the bar being raised. A couple of trailers precede the film – Clash of the Titans, an epic visual effects action film, looks laughable by comparison. And Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (which from the trailer is probably Burton's most beautiful film to date) can't match it.This is easily, I repeat easily the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. More so than any other film, I felt like I was transported to a different world, as if I was inside of a dream. And it's not just due to the 3d effect, which is so natural you will soon forget it is there, but the seamless blend of live action and special effects. In some scenes the exotic flora and fauna are displayed in all their glory in slow motion so you can really savor the details. The best special effects artists in the industry clearly believed in the project and gave it their all.The performances the world-class animators at Weta wrought from the Na'vi are just as nuanced and convincing as the best scenes with Gollum from Lord of the Rings. Though the Na'vi look more alien than Gollum their emotions come through, quite powerfully at times, and you will feel for them. The subtle hint of the actors they were based on gives them that extra believability, particularly with Sam Worthington's character. Neytiri, the lithe female Na'vi (to the credit of the artists) will make you a furry for the duration of the film, and you won't mind. You will wish that the beautiful but dangerous planet of Pandora was a real place; the proud indigenous Na'vi a real people. Digital characters have come a verrrrrry long way from Jar Jar Binks indeed.Don't get me wrong, the story is not as groundbreaking as the visuals. They say there are no truly unique ideas left in the world, and it is easy to point out similarities to plots or ideas seen in other epic films. And it's true that the third act is pretty much balls-out action. That said, I was so swept away in what I was seeing that I could hardly care. The difference here is that this has James Cameron's signature all over it: he gets your adrenaline pumping scene after scene with hardly a chance to breathe, and somehow manages to weave it all together into a touching story with a deafening message.Everyone needs to get out and see this. Not for its story, nor for any particular visual effect, or for its use of groundbreaking 3d technology. You need to see this because the King of the World has come back from his long hiatus and brought back something truly spectacular. Unlike Lucas, Cameron hasn't lost his touch. Bring on Battle Angel, your highness, but if you want to revisit Pandora I'll gladly come along for another ride."
"Avatar The movie Avatar is a great movie that shows people that when we as humans want something we will stop at nothing to get it. Even if that means we destroy sacred things in the process. The theme of this movie is nothing good can come from being greedy. The actors in this movie are Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, Sigourney Weaver as Grace, Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, and Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacon.In the beginning of Avatar Jake is transported to Pandora to take over the work of his brothers Avatar. Jake is asked to do this because his brother was shot and killed. Once Jake reaches Pandora he is briefed on protocols and is shown around the compound. While looking around Colonel Miles asks him if he would get inside information from the Navi for him while using his avatar. He wanted him to get this information so the army could use it against them and get them to leave the site they wanted without causing an invasion. He also wanted Jake to convince them to leave Hometree. Colonel Miles tells Jake that if he can do this for him he will make sure he walks again. Of course Jake agrees because he knows nothing about the Na'vi, he wants to walk again, and it's his marine nature to follow the requests of an officer. Once Jake goes out into Pandora in his avatar he gets left behind and comes face to face with some of its creatures. While he is trying to save himself Neytiri saves him and becomes really upset because the creatures didn't have to die. She tells him to go back, but he continues to follow her. She sees the seeds of Ewya landing on him and then tells him to follow her. After this encounter with Jake she eventually takes him to meet her parents and the rest of the Navi. He goes to Hometree and tells Neytiri's mother that he is a dream walker and that he is there to learn about them. Neytiri's mother than tastes Jake's blood and realizes it is the will of Ewya for him to be one them and Neytiri is supposed to teach him. He is learning more and more each time he comes back as his avatar and eventually gets to know why the Na'vi won't leave Hometree. He learns that it is a there home and it houses all of them in it. He also learns that the Tree of Souls is very important to the Na'vi because they can bond with it and learn from their ancestors. Jake tells the Colonel that there is no way the Na'vi will leave. This is where the Colonel decides it is time for war. He thinks this is the only way to get what he wants. He doesn't care that he will be destroying the sacred places of these people and their homes. This is where his greed gets in the way of what is right. The Colonel prepares for war and takes it to the Na'vi. He starts destroying Hometree. The Na'vi are fleeing and scared they cannot believe this is happening. They flee to the Tree of Souls and regroup. Once at the tree of souls Jake decides to talk to the tree and ask for help. He also speaks with the other Na'vi and they decide they need to ask the other Na'vi clans for help. They decide to help. The war breaks out and the Na'vi start fighting back and when you think all hope is lost the animals of the planet come to the rescue and help. Neytiri says Ewya answered the request and has helped them. Jake is found by Colonel Miles in the camp and tries to kill the human Jake. Neytiri finds him and shots the Colonel with an arrow and saves Jake. After the Na'vi win the war basically Jake decides he wants to be a Na'vi permanently. He is then taken to the Tree of souls and Neytiri's mother asks the tree if she can make Jake one of them. At the end of the movie Jake is now a Na'vi and this is where he belongs.This movie shows that nothing good can come from being greedy. The humans started a war with a native race of Pandora for a metal. They were willing to kill people and destroyed their homes for this mineral. Since the Colonel was so greedy innocent people lost their lives. Two techniques that were present in this movie were the colors and the computer generated imaging. The colors in this movie were amazing. There were dull colors when there were scenes at the compound. These were colors that we see every day. They are the normal colors for us humans. On Pandora the colors were rich and vibrant. They brought the planet to life and showed us just how amazing it was. These colors were bright and vibrant. They showed us just how alive everything was. The computer generated imagery was amazing. It played a big part in this movie because it is what made the avatars. They took the pictures of the actors and fused it with some graphics and made the avatars look just like the actors real faces. It was amazing they looked so real."
"Absolutely the very best movie ever made or that will ever be made. It will never be topped in the past, this or any other century. Bureaucrats at the UN Climate Summit in Durban have outlined plans for the most draconian, harebrained and madcap climate change treaty ever produced, under which the west would be mandated to respect ""the rights of Mother Earth"" by paying a ""climate debt"" which would act as a slush fund for bankrolling an all-powerful world government. Even as the tattered shreds of whatever credibility global warming alarmists had left evaporate in the aftermath of Climategate 2.0, the monstrous bureaucracy behind ManBearPig continues to lurch forward.Lord Christopher Monckton's extensive report breaks down the key aspects of the current draft text."
"when i first saw trailers i thought it was completely stupid but i never say so because of course i'd never seen it and I'm not quick to judge. movie comes out and like everyone else i kept seeing all these good reviews and people saying it is a masterpiece, basically all this hype. CGI graphics, okay this has been done before but i can hang what? almost 3 hours? well a lot of good movies are 3 hours long. FINE i watched it.....twice i DIDN'T get it. this was supposed to be ""ORIGINAL"" yet the whole time i was watching i kept thinking to myself, ""Didn't i see this in...."" the whole plot has been done and over done so many times in so many movies it's not even funny anymore. it wasn't that good!I DON'T UNDERSTAND! It was mediocre at best with graphics that have been used before. I'm guessing it was made for the easily impressed that clearly aren't aware of whats going on around them and are fascinated by talking blue cats.SAD."
I cant believe how many bad reviews I've read for this. are these people insane or are they just trying to put people off the movie? Well let me tell you this. I loved every single mindblowing second of it. This film I believe will hit $4 billion without a doubt. And will deserve it. After watching i stayed up for hours after it just thinking about how good the film was and how amazing everything looked. Top notch acting. Top notch storyline. Amazing work fair play. If you have not seen it..go see it now!best film ever made.
"I rated this picture ten out of ten. Firstly because I am a Sigourney Weaver fan and she never gets less than eight from these quarters. But the big news is Sam Worthington who puts all the usual waxed muscle-bound boys to shame with his arresting yet unobtrusive good looks. It is easy to identify with him which is essential if one wants to get into groove with this spectacular film. Thank you Mr. Cameron for excellent entertainment and food for thought, environmentally I mean. In any case a great picture, much better than The Hurt Locker which was at best boring. I bought the disc so hopefully some of the royalties will go into making another great picture for us mortals to enjoy."
"Avatar released in 3D has just created a hype around everywhere in the world.Now everyone wants to see a 3D movie.Such is the impact that Avatar has left.Plot wise it was a failure but who wants to see the plot if you could see mystique creatures flying around in 3D.Enough of this sci-fi stuff but lets get back to the plot.Though technically brilliant,this James Cameroon movie has a very much trite kind of a plot to understand.Sam Worthington as Jake Sully has done very well.But his true identity seems to be lost in the Avatar attire.Same can be said for Zoe Saldana as well.The story mainly revolves around their love affair in that Fabulous Avatar attire.Rest of the casting is pretty OK.What Avatar has done is that it has laid a terrific platform for a lot of new upcoming movies.Even the old ones,if you just think,LOTR or King Kong or even Jurassic Park in 3D.That would be something.Good direction by James Cameroon & mind-blowing cinematography by Mauro Fiore.I gave blade runner just my 9 because i felt that it was something unique my eyes have seen.Same goes for Avatar too.Avatar for me is a quantum leap in Cinematic Viewing."
"Star Wars has been my all time favorite movie for 26 years. Not only did the movie suck you in to an imaginative world but the impact of the movie changed the way movie makers made films. Some came close, The Lord of the Rings with flawless animation and a spectacular fantasy world, Matrix pounding out all new special effects , The Dark Knight showed us what an amazing performance from one man can do to an already great flick. I have been waiting for Halo to become a movie, I believed that it had a chance since it already has a great story, but now I am not waiting for Halo to be made. For the first time I can confidently say Avatar is the greatest movie I have ever seen. This is the only movie I ever experienced rather then watched. One could say that the book is always better then the movie, well not with Avatar. I felt like I was an extra in the movie just enjoying everything that was going on. The impact of this innovating movie will make all movie makers search for more creative ways to keep up. The only problem now is watching a new movie that I know will not be as good."
"This story really shows how cool a world could be without the burdens of Money & Technology. My family are all techno nuts, but after seeing this film - we would all move to Pandora & become Na'vi without a second thought.I have always liked James Camerons work, but this is just so superb in visuals & characters that it has to be his best so far.Ups: Escapism at its best. Brilliant world design. The Na'vi are so believable as are creatures & life on Pandora. Makes you really care about them.Downs: Predictable story progress - but who cares - we got away from planet Earth for a couple of hours & didn't want to come back.....Its a shame that its just a story."
"To start things of - the 3D technology used in this film is mind blowing, fantastic, extraordinary etc etc. I was very surprised by just how well the 3D worked, and a lot of the scenes in the movie are shot to make the most out of the 3D effects. That said, the movie in it self is nothing special - understand me right, it is not an awful movie, its just not that good either and it is obviously a show off movie for the 3D format. The plot has been done before in a number of different scenarios, the characters were all just typical Hollywood archetypes, and the acting was not really inspiring. Further, the special effects and the ""gadgets"" used was nothing to write home about. I was however entertained throughout the movie, but a lot of that has to do with the 3D, and not the movie in it self. If the movie had been an ordinary 2D movie, then the 2h30 m would have been (far) too long, but in 3D it's just the right length.When there are 30 or more pictures out in the 3D format, this picture will stand out only as being the first. But a welcomed first - what a format, the 3D is."
"To explain the vote; on a basis that the grade is divided equally between visual and mental, I am sure you guessed it: 5 out of 5 on graphics, 0 out of 5 on story.Many will argue that Avatar focused on the effects, but to neglect the story that much is plain retarded. For the fans of Braveheart, the story will satisfy, but for anyone looking for a witty or bright or original or visionary script, forget it. Very disappointing, when you have such possibilities, to fall flat like that with the story.I will although praise the artists of this ""Other World"", never has an alien world been rendered this beautifully, full marks from the eyes!It's still a very enjoyable experience, ONLY in 3D, it starts falling flat towards the two thirds but then accelerates with the finale... Overall am happy to see it and would recommend seeing it, mainly because we still can watch 3D at home :)"
"I just watched this movie, and I am totally stunned by the beautiful creatures The movie's got great GGI and I think James Cameron is so creative in creating the film....Good music, good acting,good plot. I strongly hope that this will win Best Piture Oscar, like Cameron's previous disaster-romance, drama, Titanic.The world of Pandora made me hope that it was real and I am dreaming to transform into one of the Na'vis, like Jake Sully does. This imaginative world makes you dream... It's just like pochahontas meets the matrix, indigenous people meet the tehnology. What are you waiting for???? watch this epic!!!!!!!!!!You won't regret it even though it is a hell of long movie. You won't e wasting your tickets, people..... 5/5!!!!!!!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"An $8.50 movie I spent $15.50 to see.Cameron rehashes plots from A Man Called Horse, Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai and countless 'indigenous species threatened by humans despite their greater humanity' science fiction novels.In fact I found a considerable parallelism between the society of the Na'vi and the society of David Weber's Treecats from the Honor Harrington novels, a nearly plagiarist parallelism that if I really had any hope of caring about the movie I might investigate further.Cameron's CGI efforts are notable, though he could have taken a chance like Hironobu Sakaguchi and Moto Sakakibara did in Final Fantasy: Spirits Within and had at least one CGI character with loose hair. Since Cameron only had twice the budget and 6 times the computing power he must have thought loose hair was extravagant.The CGI is good, on a par with that of Spirits Within or LotR or even Starship Troopers, but perhaps the quality would have been more obvious if half of the data wasn't washed out with the attempt at displaying the movie in 3D.So to summarize: A hackneyed nearly plagiarized plot, an adequate effort at CGI so that leaves continuity and acting to save this effort. And it does.Really, I came to watch Avatar because I have come to respect Sam Worthington, especially after watching Judgement Day once again. Worthington and Weaver both provide an excellent and solid portrayal of their characters and everyone else seems to be carried right along as well.After finally seeing Titanic I was expecting a bit more out of Cameron for continuity but really everything I saw was nit-picky so really not concerning.but really people, it isn't worth the effort you're putting into it."
"Avatar is quite a visual masterpiece, and a real credit to just how far we've come in modern film. There's been too much abuse of CGI (Michael Bay, and your buddy Roland Emmerich) in too many modern blockbusters that the term ""special effects"" seems to go hand in hand with movies that are hastily written, badly directed, and more carnage than actual plot. ""Avatar"" sets a new standard for CGI, using effects for their original intended purpose, that is to accentuate the film itself, rather than as a mere decorative distraction.So much of this film screamed ""Star Wars"" and ""Jurassic Park"" to me. As a film student I often am at odds with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, as they are the fathers of modern cinema, but have also bastardized their own legacies in horrible ways. Its difficult to see Lucas as the man behind ILM, THX, Pixar, and the original ""Star Wars"" film, and also the travesty that became the ""Star Wars"" prequels. Its even harder to reconcile Spielberg's definitive masterpieces, ""Schindler's List"", ""E.T."", and remember that he was the mogul who greenlit Transformers and defaced Indiana Jones' legacy with that completely unnecessary and irreverent fourth film.But one has to remember what ""Star Wars"" meant to the world, how Lucas defined a new standard in sound (Dolby Digital) and special effects from a ragtag group of geeks who tinkered in a garage. Most of all, Lucas was the first to openly defy the studio system, going with the story that seemed an improbably success, securing his own rights to everything that he had created. ""Star Wars"" rejuvenated cinema because it was a movie that you had to see in theaters to get the full experience of his wild space saga. Jurassic Park was more of the same. When Dr. Grant sees the dinosaurs for the first time, there is just a feeling of complete awe that is so rare in movies nowadays.Seeing ""Avatar"" was like that. It was such an experience, especially in 3D, that you couldn't look away, couldn't even think about anything but the lush imagery of the film itself. Watching ""Avatar"" made me feel pure thrill at seeing scenery unfold, and although it is much to early to much such declarations, it may be a defining moment in cinema for my generation.That's not to say that this is the perfect movie, or the most amazing thing that I've ever seen. The plot is heavily clichéd, since ""Avatar"" really is a mix of the ""Matrix"", ""Pocahontas"", and the two aforementioned movies. As a culture, after dealing with the likes of M. Night Shyamalan and five seasons of ""Lost"", the plot for ""Avatar"" was pretty standard and easy to predict. There is an epic battle scene, which trickles down to basically hand to hand combat (or as close as it gets) between the hero and the baddie. Character-wise there is Jake Sully, the average-Joe of a protagonist, a wounded and world-weary ex-Marine to boot. There's Neytiri, the native Princess who teaches Sully the ways of the forest, and Stephen Lang plays the psychotic army Colonel who is hell-bent on being destructive and generally a pain in the ass. (A good year for Lang, after his wacky turn as a peace & love army guy in ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"").However, this characterization can be once again be viewed as using archetypes from mythology as discussed in Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"". I'd put money on the fact that James Cameron knows and has read Campbell's stuff, which identifies the underlying patterns in myths and legends, as well as spiritual traditions.In Christopher Volger's ""The Writer's Journey"", Volger expands Campbell's work from the 1940s into a framework for plot and character development in fiction, i.e. the formula for success. And it fits almost perfectly. When compared to ""Star Wars"", which was a huge influence on Cameron (it being the film that caused Cameron to quit his job as a truck driver and enter the film industry). the hero, mentor, villain, roles are pretty clear-cut and similar. For example, both mentor characters (Dr. Grace Augustine/Obi-Wan Kenobi) are killed by the villains, and end up guiding from the netherworld, as part of the spirit of the forest/the Force, which I think are the same thing. We even have a snarky, bad-ass pilot with both a Millennium Falcon and a last-minute change of heart of her own, echoing in the tradition of Han Solo. Well if it works, it works.What has endeared ""Avatar"" to me most of all is the technological breakthrough. For too long we've been trying to explain and confront the demise of cinema, because people simply haven't been going to see movies. Unfortunately, this takes away from our generation the experience of movie-going, of being in a crowded theater with other people and sharing a story with them. James Cameron has taken a huge step in bringing the cinema back, with 3-D and IMAX cameras that offer an experience that one can't replicate at home. The 3-D shows were sold out at the first theater that I tried to get tickets at, while the 2-D ones were mostly empty, even though you have to cough up an extra 3 or 4 dollars for the special glasses. Certainly an indicator of 3-Ds appeal.Will this last? I've been so sick of watching 3-D movies that do things for the sake of being 3-D, such as ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" last summer, when things were constantly being flung at your face, from rocks to dinosaur saliva, to Brendan Fraser's ass. Like special effects, 3-D will have to be used carefully and wisely to avoid becoming a euphemism for ""shitty"". But we'll cross that road when we come to it, I suppose."
"Technichally, with regards to visuals, this movie is outstanding. The world of Pandora was excellently produced. However, as far as the story and characters go....meh.I am not a troll and I try to find something positive in everything. That being said, I was disappointed by this movie. About half way through I turned to my friend and said, ""I liked this better the first time when it was called 'Dances With Wolves'.""Storywise, Avatar was much more than similar, all the way down to the narration. So much so that I was disappointed a third of the way into the movie, being able to predict exactly what happens. Unfortunately, I hit it right on the nose. I was surprised that James Cameron, who in my opinion has never made a bad movie (at least that I have seen), wrote a story that was so unoriginal.On top of that, the characters, with the exception of maybe Sigourney Weaver's, were pretty one dimensional and cliché. I also have to commend Zoe Saldana for her ability to convey a lot of emotion through a CGI character. However, Giovanni Robisi did his best Giovanni Ribisi impression, and Colonel Quatrich was the most cliché military bad guy any of us could have come up with.Im not saying this was a bad movie, in fact it WAS enjoyable. However, was it the end all be all that people seem to think it is? No, it is not. Does it deserve to be #32 on the Top 250? Not even close.As an earlier reviewer put it, if you want a decent popcorn flick and cool special effects, this is a great movie to spend on a Saturday afternoon (when football season is over). However, if you are looking for something completely original, watch Terminator."
"AvatarThis motion-capture film is directed by James Cameron. I saw it in 3D Imax, and I recommend that version for the effects. The plot is nothing special: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.Our hero is Jake Sully, and he's a paraplegic whose twin brother died. His twin was scheduled to control an avatar on the planet Pandora, an avatar cued to his DNA. Since they were twins, Jake can take his place but hasn't had the training, so we get to watch Jake get all the stuff explained to him so we know what's going on. Obvious plot device. Generally, the planet Pandora has a mineral we want for commercial purposes, but the planet is inhabited by people who are connected physically and spiritually to the entire planet and its biosphere, and these people don't want us taking their stuff. Jake is sent to the planet's surface where he assumes the shape of a local inhabitant through the magic of science - he's an avatar with full mobility again. His goals are (a) get the inhabitants to agree to us taking the mineral and (b) failing that, discover how to destroy their home most effectively so we can take the mineral with least cost (in lives and money). Naturally, Jake falls in love and becomes one with the planet himself. He leads the aliens to a successful uprising against the hostile corporate take over.The plot has been compared to ""Pocahontas"" and ""Dances with Wolves."" I'd guess that's fairly accurate. It's not a bad movie as movies go - good action, great effects. The bad guys are too cartoonish for my tastes, and the ending is deus ex machina, which I didn't like. However, the 3D Imax experience overwhelmed my sense of good film and gave me enough pleasure to like the movie.The effects people and the art and visual designers really knocked my socks off. One of the problems with computer-generated imagery and motion capture movies is the sterility of the ""sets"" and the lack of grounding of the characters in the world they're supposed to be inhabiting. When real people walk the real ground, they affect the ground - when cartoon characters walk on the ground, there's no disturbance. ""Avatar"" gets around this in part by having a world that is phosphorescent, so when the characters step on things, the things glow. In other scenes, however, the computer-generated characters float on the ground without interacting with it. There's no real feedback from the environment to the characters.The visuals were compelling - I got a little motion sick from some scenes, just as I would have in real life. The 3D camera work really works - I felt some of the objects were definitely in front of the movie screen - and Cameron didn't play it for cheap thrills. (They were very expensive thrills.) I think ""Avatar"" is a major step forward in motion picture production, comparable to the coming of sound and color.There are, of course, problems. Motion capture means we see computer-generated characters. Whether you care about what is basically a cartoon is not something I can predict. I don't foresee motion capture as a wave of the future, but that may be a reflection of my generation rather than an accurate forecast. My habit has been to see and care about characters played by Jimmy Stewart, Humphrey Bogart, Morton Downey, Jr., George Clooney; Meryl Streep, Audrey Hepburn, Tilda Swinton, Ingrid Bergman.Additionally, the bad guys were so overdone they left me vaguely sick. There were no redeeming virtues - the bad guys were bad all the way through. We had no background that gave us reasons; we had no internal struggles with what would have been right. I'd contrast these cartoons with Heath Ledger's The Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" His character was fully developed, and we understood his evil and felt sorry for him. In ""Avatar,"" Quaritch and Selfridge had no depth.Ultimately, the world Cameron created and the story worked for me. I think, though, that seeing it in 3D Imax made a significant difference from watching in 2D. I recommend seeing the film in 3D if at all possible. I think the 3D Imax effects cover up a lot of sins.NOTES ABOUT IDEOLOGY AND SOME American OBJECTIONS. SPOILERS.Some Americans see this movie as anti-American, anti-capitalism, and anti-religion. While I'll lend some credence to those points of view, they're overblown. I've read about pre-literate humans and their rituals for thanking the animals for sacrificing their lives so that the humans might eat them, and the aliens in ""Avatar"" have this same ritual. I think having it here helps establish the world of the aliens and connects me to it: their world is the world of our Stone Age ancestors, where everything is connected and life is lived among creatures who have a right to exist. This is the basis for the objection to taking the minerals from the planet. It all has a right to exist. By casting the villain as corporation with military muscle, Cameron picked an obvious target. He did it badly, though, and that's my objection. It's possible to read the movie as a rant against the rape of our planet. It's possible to read the assault on a Stone Age populace as an attack on American military ventures in the Middle East. It's possible to see the exposition of the alien ""religion"" as an attack on American monotheism. I though it was just a movie with good action and great special effects. It wasn't good enough for me to take seriously as a metaphor for anything. From my point of view, the people who were offended by the movie tell me more about themselves than they do about the movie. Your mileage will vary."
"Avatar kept me fascinated about halfway through the film. This because of the sheer amount of creativity in the visual effects (The whole film is more or less a 150 minute visual effect). For that, the team at WETA around Richard Taylor deserves every award that relates to art direction, visual effects one can throw at them. The flora and fauna on Pandora is extraordinarily well crafted and abundant of new and bizarre life forms. The virtual characters of the Na'Vi are so far the closest to believable ""real"" creatures, maybe with the exception of the great ape in ""King Kong"" which I personally find unmatched yet. It is thus the logical evolution of WETAs progress into the virtual realm which started in ""The Lord of the Rings"" where Gollum was the first step towards creating a believable virtual character. Yet the film still centered around human characters. In King Kong, the great ape already consumed 50% of the presence, and in ""Avatar"" the virtual characters do 70-80% of the acting (at least that's how it feels). In this respect, the film is really groundbreaking and the 3D enhances the feeling of realism in a great way. But the story of the film is too predictable and has been told a few times before. I immediately recognized ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Lord of the Rings (no surprise), and ""Final Fantasy"". I think the story / idea of the film has a lot more potential than just laying the backdrop for a standard action film. It could touch other, deeper questions, e.g. how jack Scully handles the inner conflict of being human half of the time and a Na'Vi half of the other time. How is it to fall in love with an Alien? Even if he sees Pandore through the eyes of a Na'Vi, he still has a human mind, right? There are many psychological and philosophical aspects that this film could touch. But the way the story evolves and the predictability made the film feel too long by at least 30 minutes. Nevertheless, this film is a must see for all those who want to see a technical milestone in film-making and for those, who haven't seen yet too many films where tension is created by applying the usual count-down tricks (""30 seconds before detonation..."")."
"OK, this movie certainly has got a lot of wonderful visuals, the characters are impressive (because they look real, not because of the script), that is true.BUT the story is so weak!Guy goes to some planet, people tell him to betrayal the natives, but, in the end, he can't do it. Add a ridiculous ""let's save the planet"" appeal and that's it.This movie is a blockbuster without spirit. Or do you think that Avatar is better than Sunset Boulevard, Dr.Strangelove and Apocalypse Now?I know the top 250 isn't very reliable, but let's respect the true masterpieces and put Avatar on it's place. Cameron did a good job, but nothing revolutionary."
"After the decade plus wait for Avatar, the special effects certainly do not disappoint. They are without a doubt the best any movie has produced ever and no one would dare argue with that. However, as a film I was expecting more from James Cameron, he has produced some monumental films in the past that have been brilliant aside from the special effects. Avatar is not. It is riddled with every cliché war/uprising films have produced in the last 20 years; the dialogue was very poor really for someone who has been in the field as long as James Cameron has. Nevertheless, i am glad i went to see it and i'm sure it will be remembering as a landmark for future blockbusters, and with good cause, the 3D was nothing short of stunning particularly when the ash was falling in the aftermath. Still, with a bit of work, it could have been so much better."
"When I sat down in the theater with my soda and popcorn, I nearly spilled it all on myself. This movie was so mind-blowing and amazing that I wouldn't mind going back and watching it again! The plot of the movie was fantastic with amazing special effects. It has moral-raising parts where when Jake was raising telling the Na-vi people that they will fight. And back to the special effects. Never before have I ever seen such great effects from the missile-firing part. This is when the planes were shooting multiple missiles into the big tree. The creatures that exist in Pandora are well developed and well played. I wish I could ride on one of those flying ""things."" I really recommend watching it in 3D. It is as if you are part of the movie instead of just watching it. It feels as if you are on Pandora yourself and you experience all that the characters are experiencing. Overall, this is just a well, well, made film. I have yet to see a better movie than this one."
"Wow! What an A+ viewing experience! The 3D was superb with very little of that in-your-face 3D effect. It was mostly a depth-perception that worked very, very well. A MUST see movie. The problem is with the message of the movie. Without giving any specifics away, it could have been written by Greenpeace or by one of those wacko save-the-earth, America is evil, man can only destroy, hate the military, we are one with the planet members. AND it is most definitely ""Pantheistic"", meaning those who believe that nature is god and is to be worshiped; AlGore-like. The story would have been far better had terrorists from another planet tried to kill the nice blue people with the nice blue people defeating the terrorists...and, maybe with the help of America or earthlings!"
"...perhaps it will be possible to use it to revisit old films and provide them with a decent plot twist here and there rather than ""Tarzan rehash #9004"" as provided by 'Avatar'. Yes it looks great, the sound is decent, but the only surprise to be had here is that a man can spend ten years on a project and come up with something so bland and, somewhat ironically, one dimensional.Over the last couple of days I've suffered my way through this and Lars von Trier's 'Anti Christ' and although aimed at very different audiences they both fail to raise themselves above hollow spectacle.In the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is busy trying to explain to everyone how 'Avatar' can be rated as one of the top 250 films of all time."
"I went to see this movie after all my friends already saw it. What I got from them was that this movie is all about the visuals, and nothing about the story. They could not have been any wronger.Yes, the visuals are amazing, but what's more amazing than them is the world they create, and how it instantly drags you in. The plot is full of clichés, but it is so well done that you won't mind them at all. You end up connecting with the Na'vi, and see things from a whole new and welcomed perspective.As for the acting, nothing out of the ordinary, except for Zoe Saldana, who does an absolutely excellent job, even through a CGI. The power and emotion she is able to inspire is unbelievable. If that's not worth an Oscar nomination, I don't know what is.All in all, this movie managed to surprise me in many ways, when all I expected were some ""amazing CGI's"". Like someone else from around here said, you need to feel the movie, not just see it."
"I happened to watch the movie today. It was exceptional in every way and the words are simply not enough to describe the experience. The only advice I can give is, if you didn't see this yet, go see it, for if you don't, you are missing a part in your life! I do not give a general account of the movie as there are plenty of them around already. I'd like to explain something else instead.The movie is an ensemble of genres – action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi, etc. The movie, which has been portrayed as a fictional story that takes place in some period of time in the projected future, coincidentally, and most intriguingly, is an echo from the history.The historic incidence takes place in the very country the movie was produced. Unlike the movie, in this incidence, the good guys get wiped out from the face of the earth and the bad guys go on and build a modernized civilization.In 1854 March 11, a meeting takes place in Washington, called by Isaac Stevens – governor to the region, regarding the surrender or sale of the native land to the white visitors arriving to settle there. The following is an extract of the speech the leader of the native tribes (Red Indians) – Chief Seattle made in the event:~~~~~~ extracts of Seattle's speech ~~~~~~ ""The President in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land. But how can you buy or sell the sky? the land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them?Every part of the earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every meadow, every humming insect. All are holy in the memory and experience of my people. We know the sap which courses through the trees as we know the blood that courses through our veins. We are part of the earth and it is part of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters. The bear, the deer, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the dew in the meadow, the body heat of the pony, and man all belong to the same family.The shining water that moves in the streams and rivers is not just water, but the blood of our ancestors. If we sell you our land, you must remember that it is sacred. Each glossy reflection in the clear waters of the lakes tells of events and memories in the life of my people. The water's murmur is the voice of my father's father...Will you teach your children what we have taught our children? That the earth is our mother? What befalls the earth befalls all the sons of the earth...Your destiny is a mystery to us. What will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered? The wild horses tamed? What will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of many men and the view of the ripe hills is blotted with talking wires? Where will the thicket be? Gone! Where will the eagle be? Gone! And what is to say goodbye to the swift pony and then hunt? The end of living and the beginning of survival.We love this earth as a newborn loves its mother's heartbeat  Preserve the land for all children, and love it, as God loves us  As we are part of the land, you too are part of the land. This earth is precious to us. It is also precious to you"" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the present day, we all know that we have not been able to understand what Seattle and the native Red Indians understood back then. And we are paying a heavy price already as we are facing the catastrophic consequences of the mistake - in the form the greenhouse effect, global warming and the myriad of accompanying environmental anomalies, in return for the irreversible damage we have done to our Mother Nature.The Avatar, is a 'second-opportunity' for us - the 'modern - civilized world' to realize what we failed to realize back in the days where we should have.The whole cinematic experience delivered by the movie opens up our eyes, minds and souls to a new dimension that Seattle and the Red Indians saw and lived in. Would we really be able to sense it and act is a question we don't have an answer in the horizon... yet..."
"After all those comments one can hardly add anything clever. Still, 24 hours after I have seen the movie, I feel like I have something to say. Story that makes you think about planet you live on, music that makes you buy soundtrack even if you know it will not be equally fun just to listen it without complete scenes, production that makes you wish you have better cinema in town In general, this is one great illustration of trust, modesty, and something we like to call sustainable development. Or it is just my impression. Anyway, if you haven't done it yet – please go to the best cinema you can reach, and watch this master-peace."
"AVATAR...A Wonderful Cinematic Experience It is a great cinematic experience. Wonderful acting skills in a super cool and astonishing environment. Wonderful work once again by the great James Cameron.Wonderful acting skills and a perfect combination of Action, Romance, Sci-Fi, Adventure. Action, emotions, stunts, special effects are worth watching.. however the music fails to touch the soul as in the case of TITANIC100% recommended movie and worth watch a multiple times. The movie is much better experience when watched in 3D.So just get out of your house this weekend and enjoy the movie with a tub of popcorn!!!"
"OK, I realised years ago that I wanted to be a film-maker, but it wasn't until yesterday when I watched AVATAR in 3D (unfortunately in REAL MAX 3D, since IMAX is booked till January and I could not wait that long) that I knew I most definitely want to make films, no questions asked. I was out of breath in wonder, I had to remain in my seat for more than two minutes after the viewing was complete,the experience thinking about it is so great that I can feel my eyes watering up a bit. Tears of happiness.I asked my self as I were watching the film, is there any other way to view this, and the answer is indisputably NO!. If you have not seen this movie, take your family and friends with you right NOW!, thanks James for such a jewel to cinema, and for pushing the envelope for us aspiring film-makers.Obviously my vote was 10, not sure why its still at 25? in the top 250, in a week it must be NO1! William."
"Avatar was well filmed, had groundbreaking special effects, a great cast, and a great soundtrack (although Horner still made parts of this sound a little too much like 'Titanic'). Unfortunately, this film was almost ruined by its political overtones and predictability. The amount of references to politics (i.e. ""shock and awe"" and ""your either with us or against us"") transformed what could have been greatness into a predictable bunch of Bush bashing, with a predictable ending. Also, the predictability factor seemed even higher with the blatant copying of the forest battle in ""Return of the Jedi"" and perhaps a little from the ""Dragon Riders of Pern"" novels. Yes, it's still worth seeing, but it's just too blatant of a political soapbox and too predictable to be great. Too bad, but still fun."
"Yesterday evening I went to Avatar. I avoided reading reviews before for my full enjoyment - I was sure that Avatar will be great movie - like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings or Matrix.James Cameron is truly a brilliant mind. He managed to do an extraordinary combination of feelings, evidence and arguments in a world full of harmony, in contrast to human behaviors in these days - evilness, selfishness, all for money and material satisfactions. But Avatar not only shows the humans with washed brains or humans who had lost their love for nature and others, it's about some good people that are able to leave their race to support another for a good cause. Like in Avatar, in reality, to change something on the ground requires the intervention of a deity. And we need help.I think any person with feelings will be impressed by Avatar."
"As usual, James Cameron delivers a visual and technological tour de force while simultaneously proving that he has zero narrative originality and horribly clichéd story-telling concepts. In a different era, a writer director that put out this leftist propaganda would have been tarred, feathered and run out of town on a rail or perhaps even hung for treason. In our era of hypocrisy, no one even chuckles that a megalomaniac tycoon produces, writes or directs a multi-million dollar movie critical of the very economic conditions which ALLOWED IT TO BE MADE. Lame quasi-native American themes of ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""A Man Called Horse"" are clumsily interspersed with naive callow condemnation of corporate greed and the war on terror. A general nature worship pantheism pervades the shallow and ignorant philosophy shoved down the viewers throats. The bio-luminescent plant life is vaguely reminiscent of ""Lothlorien"" in Lord of the Rings and is very beautiful until you realize that from a biological standpoint it serves no purpose and thus wouldn't exist. Alan Dean Foster's ""Midworld"" is not the least of sci-fi authors who deserve credit or at least mention by Cameron for his ""Pandora"". The portrayal of the military in this film is insulting, naive and maybe treasonable."
"If u have kids, Avatar may be a nice way to spend a family afternoon, but for people above 15 years of age, it brings nothing but an itchy, uncomfortable need to erase that movie experience from one's memory. While sitting in the cinema with the 3d glasses on, you will probably enjoy the first half (if your teeth are sharp enough to protect you from the Kitsch Monster), but then you get the point when you clearly see where the movie is heading and the only possible feeling is irritation. The repetition of trite motives doesn't even provide you with nostalgia, it is annoying, boring and totally predictive in a Rambo manner. When it comes to storytelling, Avatar is as old-fashioned as poor Mrs Weaver's horrible hairstyle. Big disappointment"
"The visuals were amazing, I'll give James Cameron that. But the story was unoriginal and the audio wasn't nearly as good as some movies from the late 90's. There was an obvious undertone to the movie that would have liberal tree-huggers jumping for joy. Only in fairy tales would you have Caucasians and military be a bad thing.This movie is simply Ferngully on video steroids. This is not a redefinition of movies. The Matrix was far more defining. This type of video from the consumer perspective was already done in Beowulf and 300 to name a few. The creatures weren't well thought of, George Lucas has much better imagination. I've seen all the flora on earth during my scuba dives, and the fauna were earth creatures with one extra tweak, the the main characters were just blue Indians, like The Blue Man Group meets Pocahontas.Don't spend the money, wait until Netflix. The high rating will go down after the hype wears off."
"I believe my review can be summed up with the following Facebook conversation with my dear friend, Hannah. Me: We saw Avatar 3D this morning. It was... alright. Long. Good special effects but the story was pretty much Pocahontas if John Smith was the main character and it was 150 years in the future.Hannah: I thought it was long too! And I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought it was only alright. What didn't you like about it? Or what made it not OMG FANTASTIC? :3Me: It must have been almost 3 hours!! The story was so clichéd, and I didn't like any of the characters. The 3D was really cool, though, and I really want to go and live in that forest.Hannah: It was, actually. 2hrs, 55mins! Also, we are twins! It was the cliché that got me. Usually, clichés are okay with me, but you could predict things so far ahead. ""Dragon thing nobody else can ride? Yeah, he'll do it. Oh look, he's done it."" And... now that you mention it, I didn't have any emotional connection to any character. But I admire the complexity of the world... Like, that alone would have taken years to come up with. So many subtleties that nobody would really appreciate, but made it so real... I want a forest like that :DMe: AHH THAT'S SO LONG for such a story. It was so predictable. As soon as the female Na'vi (can't remember her name) saved him I thought 'They'll end up together'. You see the Colonel guy, you know he's evil. And of course you know Jake's gonna end up picking the natives over the cruel, terrible, heartless humans... Action bores me sometimes - especially that last battle scene, which I thought was so pointless and superfluous - WHY did they fight again? Oh RIGHT, because they HAVE to stand up to the humans SOMEHOW, even if it's suicidal. It was VERY complex. I watched for lots of little details and thought it was really cool. Especially the rendering of the characters and stuff, how they were so detailed.Hannah: Yes, exactly! Like, you just knew exactly who would be with what, and... I can't of anything that made me go ""WOW, TOTALLY DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING :O"" Action is usually okay to me, but yeah, I didn't get why they fought and stuff. I mean, they won, but... We didn't see any of the grief of the people, so many things just were left unsaid. Like, did they care about all the deaths? Also, I would have thought the female would be a little more resistant to falling for him, because yanno, she was sworn to someone else... >.< My favourite part was the music... GAH, it was pretty great! *music geek* And the little things about their world... Me: I don't mind SOME action, but I get bored when action drags out. And drags out. And then just keeps going with nothing progressing... They won - HOW? Somehow! It was so improbable, because if that had *actually* happened they wouldn't have had a hope. Also, the forest probably would have burned down... because there was a hell of a lot of fire around and no one was putting it out... Wait a minute... if there was no oxygen on Pandora, how was fire able to EXIST? PLOT HOLE ALERT! to some degree. Exactly! *nods vigorously* And why did they even let him into their culture? Did they know he was a human? They knew there was something wrong with him yet somehow they were all surprised that he knew they were going to destroy the tree. The music was good, although I don't think I paid too much attention to it unfortunately. Avatar did have a good score.Hannah: OMG, you are so right about that fire thing!! GAHHHH!! Maybe it was magic fire? But seriously, they couldn't have won... Soldiers aren't THAT dumb, yanno? And then, they all turned on him when they found out he was human, but didn't Eywa love him, so shouldn't they have just trusted them? Their god had given him her blessing, so clearly he wasn't as evil as they made out... I didn't either; the sign of good music is when you don't notice it! Me: Magic fire in a magic world. Perhaps the atmosphere allowed it to burn somehow. I have no idea. Hell, why did the soldiers wait so long to dump those explosives? They would have won so quickly if they had dropped them instead of waiting til the flying creature people showed up. The whole storyline is just an exercise in convenience. 'Oh, I'll conveniently not question your mysterious past until it's dramatically convenient for plot development'. How to sum up our feelings? I suppose you could say that we believe that impressive graphics do not justify such a weak, predictable plot and one-dimensional characters. However, go see Avatar to appreciate the imaginative landscape and beautiful cinematography. Especially if you enjoy staring at pretty things for three hours."
"This has to be the mother of all predictable scripts: bad guys with big guns want to kill good guys with spears; bad guy boy meet good guy girl; bad guy boy help good guys get rid of bad guys. No twist, no surprise, no unexpected anything. Quite remarkable in its own way to be able to make a movie that is truly devoid of any storyline...It is quite ironic that they spent millions on a technology that can make CGI characters truly appear alive, with facial expressions, etc, then put a cartoonish script on top of that that makes characters look completely flat. Avatar is a technological proof of concept. Hopefully somebody will now use that technology and make a movie out of it..."
"How can a well-known movie not have any English closed captioning or subtitles available for viewers with hearing loss? Millions of dollars were spent to produce this movie and no effort or funds could be spared to make this movie accessible with captioning?I purchased this movie online via iTunes to watch via iPad and no captioning (open or closed) was available.Because of this, I rate this movie as ""awful"".I hope James Cameron or his staff realize this crucial oversight and make the updates needed. I would appreciate being receiving an updated version of this movie at no cost."
"I give this movie a 1/10 just in hopes of dragging it down from it's current unbelievably over-hyped overall rating. Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, Avatar: All the same movie. Cameron completely and utterly failed with this plot. It makes me sick how little effort he put into the plot, in fact. One would hope that a 400 million dollar budget would include a great story, however Cameron just relied on the awesome CGI instead of trying to make a real movie.It was a beautiful awe-inspiring 3-d experience: as I heard said, ""The Best roller coaster ride I've ever been on"". That's all it is. An experience. 5 years down the road when every other movie has the same layer detail of CGI as does this movie everyone will look back and laugh at this movie (IE. Jaws)."
"SPOILER ALERTI had to register simply to add my voice to those people who thought Avatar was rubbish. Effects : pretty good actually. Story : I'm sorry?Evil corporation is on a weird planet called Pandora to mine something called Unobtanium(!) which is apparently really really really expensive and therefore all means are justified to obtain it. This includes shooting natives of said planet. Marine who can't walk (No public healthcare option then) is drafted in to replace his dead brother in science program so he can control an alien body to communicate with natives. Idiot marine with no training gets in with natives where highly trained scientists could not (as he's A Warrior - something the scientists could never have thought up). He trains to be a native warrior - cue awesome effects for a very long time.I kinda lost interest here but it surprisingly turns out the Marine chief on the planet is a nutter who ends up trying to kill all the natives. Marine Who Can't Walk decides to protect the natives and handily becomes Super Warrior Native via a couple of plot devices crudely inserted into the narrative. Big battle - evil marine chief dies - planet saved - Marine Who Can't Walk becomes totally alien via other crudely inserted plot device.The effects were awesome, but the film was non-existent without the effects. Zero character development. Huge leaps of faith required to maintain disbelief. There's a scene where the good guys are rescued and fly away in a stolen helicopter. Badass Marine Dude shows how hard he is by shooting at them with a handgun instead of saying ""After them in the other 30 helicopters!""Crappy dialogue. ""The Sky-people(!) killed their mother"" - Mother = Planet1 dimensional characters ripped off from countless other films. 1.5 hours too long, I got bored and started looking at my watch after about an hour. It's been said previously but ""Dances with Wolves, done badly, in space"" with a few characters from Aliens thrown in. Machinery bad : Nature good. Unobtanium, it's called unobtanium.I cannot explain how annoyed I am that my wife and I paid £10 each to watch this pile of pap."
"This movie is meant for those who love to see without using brain and heart, You'll ask yourself ""Is it the same Cameroon, whom we know???""and most of all, the story deals with, not another planet yet an Indian Tribal Village, and that what they call ""Navi"" are the Naxalists of it, for those who don't know, are some sort of terrorist, what takes a revolutionist kind of approach to make it happen, so nothing new for me in the story, So can say Cameroon to plagiarize it ??The 2 score is only given to the feel what sometimes occurs to see the jungle,Nothing else...."
"The most visually stunning piece of film I have ever seen....Period! I saw it in IMAX 3D, and for two and a half hours, I was breathtakingly transported to another world, another universe. There simply aren't enough superlatives to describe how one feels after an Avatar movie-going experience, except to say that I WILL be going to see it again, and I wait with great anticipation for the announced sequel! Well done Mr. Cameron, you have made an instant all-time classic that will surely withstand the test of time! I hope the Motion Picture Academy, who often times seems to not reward sci-fi fantasy films with heavy CGI, will recognize the ground-breaking work done here and justly award it the Best Picture, for I think this film will have a place in the ranks of the all-time greats!"
"Collectively the media write the world of Pandora is beautiful. I ask 'to whom'.Its a bit like being in a bad floral nightclub - quite ugly colour & lighting clashing together. The utopian animals are violent, exaggerated ie lets give them 6 legs and four eyes etc long way to go re special effects. This movie lessens the naturally exceptional world we live in right now.Big big guns, really bad cartoon acting (I suppose this was directed), script to match.Why did I go.........got the short straw! Best I say no more."
"Lets start with the good points first of all i have to commend the special effects in this film which are superb. OK why did i give this such a low score simple, why spend millions of dollars on a weak story where the viewer has no compassion for any characters. The special effects should compliment a good film. There's no way I can praise the actors because they are not giving good lines to show there talents. I have seen better plots in a Steven Seagal movie. In the end your wishing the movie to be over. Yes this film is too long, i acknowledge that some great films are probably 10 or 15 mins too long like 'the dark knight', 'saving private ryan' and 'the departed' however these films entertained all the way and i wasn't in the cinema wishing the film to be over. If Avator does sweep the Oscars, i hope it doesn't pick up best actor or actress or best director or best picture.... because it simply has no right to be even considered!"
"Apart from 3D and new technologies that have been used in making this movie, there's really nothing terribly interesting about its story. Some even gone so far to compare Avatar with Matrix which is farcical. I am not sure why the writer/director James Cameron decided to combine today's thinking, 20 million dollar for a kilo of some metal, with such a futuristic story? To me, Avatar is closer to the billion Euro green ticket of 2012 than to Matrix. In 2012, people use mobiles and 'money' even after the collapse of the planet which apparently doesn't mean the collapse of markets and economy! Similarly, in Avatar people will still pay 20 million dollar for a kilo of some metal and fire 20th century rockets which really funny in such a far, really far, future. 5/10 for the 3D content only and sorry for the story."
"Just saw this movie in a 3d cinema. Very impressive concerning the imagery - I didn't see a movie which brings CGI to such a level yet, since it is very convincing even in the movement of the faces and bodies of the alien, but human-like race. But unfortunately the movie itself, i.e. the story that is being told and how this is done, is on the level of a children's movie. It's very foreseeable in all plot elements, which means: no surprises. Also after some time into the movie it seems as if every cliché you've ever seen in action movies is repeated. This gets pretty annoying. If you're a child of 12 you'll love it, otherwise you only get the effects.The only depth added to this movie is an implicit criticism of 'brute-force' capitalism. But this doesn't turn around the experience of watching this."
"It's an eternal rule of film-making that the story-arc must be powerful and the lead roles believable for any movie to make it into the top few hundred of all time. On this basis, Avatar will be quickly forgotten. The story is hackneyed and the dialogue is bland and delivered without much conviction. Director James Cameron has to take the entire responsibility for this failure, since he takes sole credit for the script. The special effects and photography and costumes are mind-boggling in 3-D, which is why the picture is watchable, but they will not combine to thrust the picture into legend. The gigantic budget of the movie could easily have gone towards dozens of engaging little films such as Juno or Once, allowing many writers and directors to get on to the big screen. One point that is key for me: Avatar breaks every single rule laid down by the Dogma Film movement(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95) that has produced so many excellent low-budget cinema experiences."
"I just watched the movie in Full HD 3D, and it was simply amazing. The attention given to detail was to such an extent that you are immersed in a whole new, and beautiful world. Calling ""Avatar"" a movie, is not even right ... it should be called an experience. This is most definitely a must for anyone who likes sci-fi and/or fantasy. It's a blend of both in such a way that I dare call it perfect. It's also a movie for all ages. Conversations are pretty easy to understand and it's packed with action (and by action I don't mean the violent combat type). Somethings might be hard to understand for children if they're too young but they definitely won't be bored. One of the best experiences you'll ever go through, so to speak ... a must see for all."
"I am sorry to admit i was given a copy of this movie, i booked tickets to watch this in 3d not only did this blow me away it set a story like the lord of the rings like star wars like the matrix, the possibility of an epic story that i feel i am personally gripped.This is not just a movie but an insight to why we all have an imagination to why every one of us is unique but at the same time understand what is our story, there is a story here lets listen we have to act, love the mother.this movie in 3d is something i have never experienced, i took my wife who does not like sci-fi but loved this but what do we expect from Cameron if i need to answer this that's 1 reason you need to watch this."
"Well the wait is finally over. Avatar promised groundbreaking special effects and whilst I'm sure it delivered in that regard, it's true majesty lies in the story it tells.It's a simple story in many respects. A native population threatens the operations of the human race, so we seek to 'remove' them by any means necessary. The natives are apparently savages who stand in the way of progress- how many times have we seen that scenario play out in human history? The unique thing here is that thanks to advanced science we can create alien bodies and put our minds into them- hence the title Avatar.The human cum alien then meets the natives in a bid to learn about them and find a peaceful solution to the crisis. He is also secretly gathering military intel, so that if things turn ugly the natives can be dealt with in the swiftest possible manner.Of course, no plans ever go smoothly and our hero finds himself becoming attracted to the life the natives lead, and finds himself falling in love with one of them. He 'finds himself' amongst these natives and decides to rebel. Nature triumphs over imperialism and all ends happily. Clichéd. certainly, but executed in breathtaking fashion."
"OK, I shall not bore you with with what's wrong with the film... a few have hinted, and I agree, the story is just OK. A bit like a child's story. Good guys, bad guys and they all lived happily ever after. But, in a way, that was a necessity. This film is so visually stimulating that a hard-to-follow, deep thought or message movie might have distracted from that.And when I say visually stimulating, I mean something we have never seen before. YOU MUST SEE IT IN 3D! I have seen other 3D films and have been amused but not blown away. They tend to feel ""dark"" like you're looking through sunglasses at night. And this film will feel that way if you sit too far back. Personally, I like seating about 3/4 of the way back in a theater. This is too far back for this film! Get close... ideally you should position yourself that your forward view allows the entire width of the viewing screen comes to the edges of your 3D glasses. This, I feel, is important to the experience. At first, we sat back a ways. But even before the film started, I decided to move up. This was a great idea. The film became much brighter and the 3D was ideal.The film is breathtaking. The depth, the intricacies, the detail are all beyond par. You can see why is took so long and cost so much. Nothing was ""short-cut"". Cameron has set the bar high for all films to follow. He has developed and perfected a technological breakthrough in cinematic experience. Never before has CGI looked so real. Never before have action scenes involving CGI been so seamless.The story (possible spoilers) flows very well. I feared that I would be required to ""rack my brain"" trying to follow the rules of a fantasy world. Such was not the case. Although we were taken to an alien world, everything made perfect sense. Motives of the characters were easy to determine and the understanding of this alien world was automatic. And because the film brings so much to the viewer in terms if that visual stimulation, you fall easily immersed in the environment that Cameron has introduced.This is what I have always imagined our future would be like. I thought that some day, long after I was gone, that man (and women) would put on some kind of helmet and a computer would connect with our senses, much like the characters in this movie connected with their Avatars. We've even been shown this likely technology before in movies like ""Strange Days"" and """". And although we humans are not yet ""hard-wired"" in... this is the beginning of that type of experience. Throw on some headphones to rid your world of outside interference, and watch a film this rich and full and you will almost become part of the story.Cameron is a genius. He knows what we want to see. He, like Spielberg, understands that audiences, for the most part, are looking to escape the confines of our dreary existence, if only for a short while, and find peace and joy and happiness in another world. Avatar takes you to that world. Cameron drops us in.I can't say enough about how unique this experience is. Even if you hate the story. Even if you are uncomfortable for the near 3-hour ride. Even if you hate fantasy. You will enjoy yourself in this escape. I find it impossible to believe that anyone would find this film unenjoyable. Some may pick it apart for the lack of story. Some, like me, will still not like fantasy in general. But everyone will enjoy this film.And this will be the beginning of an entirely new kind of filmaking. The technology he has developed in building this ""Titanic"" will change the course of movie making. Heck, I'd bet that even if this movie grossed $0, Cameron will become a billionaire from the software rights alone. Never before has CGI gone this far. Never before has it even been able to keep up with the speed of the eye. But this movie is different. This movie is so deep visually that the mind can hardly keep pace. Repeated viewings are going to be the norm on this one. It becomes almost necessary to grasp the film in it's entirety. I'm going again. I need to catch my breath first. But I'm going again. You should too, at least once!"
"The Best action/thriller/fiction movie that can touch the heart! I don't understand why this movie would get anything but 10/10 See it in 3D and live it, this is not a movie this is a dream Effects are so real that I really want to see the behind the scenes and I really wonder how did they managed this. With the 3D it blows your mind, I honestly think that someone can create such a world must have a very open and pure imagination, it is just like a dream nothing else. And I am glad the movie was 3 hours, it rarely slows down and when it does you still don't want to miss anything going on on the screen, watch the world if nothing else."
"This movie completely exceeded my expectations. From the beginning to the end it locked me into the movie, a lot of people first state the visuals when asked ""what there favorite part of the movie was"" but that's definitely secondary. Yes the visuals were amazing, but I would have to say my favorite element of the movie was the story. I was completely captivated by it, it was more epic than Lord of The Rings. Second would have to the characters. I fell in love with the characters shortly after the movie started. Jake was such a passionate character and very deep. Character build was beautiful and the characters were very deep. The mood of the movie is beautiful, it's bliss watching it, I feel apart of it, I love the music it puts a great atmosphere to it! The visuals were great. I love the magical feelings the visuals give off. This is not an organized review but just my opinion. And this movie was my favorite movie of the year by a long, a pure master piece, and surprisingly original, however it builds off from the genre of The Matrix and The Cell."
"I was hesitant to go see a movie on Christmas, only that has never been my tradition and I'm 42. Boy I'm glad I did! This has GOT to be one of the BEST movies ever made...period! The visual effects of Pandora are absolutely stunning...first of it's kind..the color, the details, the action sequences, the costumes, the characters, the animals, geography..etc.. just stunning!! The love story was done correctly, the events leading to the finale were done appropriately and so mesmerizing and almost dream-like! Lastly, the human (alien)emotion element to the effects of death, injury and loss of a tree fortress and fire, was something that many prior CGI ""blockbusters"" simply lacked, especially in that redicule of 2012. It made me shed some tears!! This masterpiece of film, is something that has never been shown in cinema before and I really hope this eliminates the tons of other trash movies that have failed miserably in the past, when it comes to the above-mentioned.I HIGHLY recommend this ""piece"" to every person in the world that can get a chance to view this spectacle of art and perfect film-making..nothing like it seen in theaters before!!!! Mr. Cameron...you are a master of film..Congratulations!! What a way to end Christmas day!!Oh, and to those critical of this masterpiece in the making, basically giving this film less than 8 rating..you're lost and have no idea what you are even talking about...cliché this, cliché that, predictable...too long of a film?? Leave the theater then...it's your loss! Can never appreciate a good film at it's best. To you dummies, nothing is ever good. Unbelievable....Must be a true reason why this masterpiece is averaging nearly a 9 rating on IMDb..and trust me, it's not by accident. Well Done!!! 11/10"
"People forget that the nature images used in Avatar come from our own beautiful planet. Sad thing is, most viewers will never get to the Amazon, or see the phosphor-luminescence of the Indian Ocean or the endless wilderness of Irian Jaya--but it's all there, and we need to care for it!! Earth, I SEE YOU (to paraphrase the movie)... If Cameron can raise people's awareness of the sanctity and interconnectedness of the world around us so that we care for it better, then I'm all for it. Regardless of one's religious beliefs, there IS a web of energy that flows through all things, and we are in the process of dismantling that, and subsequently destroying ourselves. So what he has done is a brave thing--cloak a cautionary tale inside an epic adventure--so that viewers of all ages will hopefully leave the theater and see what's around them, large and small, with new eyes. Pandora is here, right here."
"This movie will blow you away. The quality of the CGI is just breathtaking. For 2 and 1/2 hours, you will get transported to Pandora and experience a world like you have never seen before. The beauty of this place will amaze you. Its a one of a kind experience, all in 3D. This movie will also make you feel a lot of emotions. You will get attached to the Navis. You will learn their culture and their way of living. By the end of the movie you will be cheering for them.The technical team behind the specials effects deserve a lot of credit. They must of worked night and day to finish this movie.I more than recommend this movie to everyone."
"Avatar was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen! Maybe the best one! It lasted for 3 hours but it made me feel like it was only 1! I wish it lasted more actually. It didn't make me feel tired not even once, and I watched the whole movie while my excitement was getting bigger and bigger. This is so difficult to achieve in a movie specially when it's 3 hours long! Everything was just so well made,the characters, the different places.. Just so beautiful! I am just so happy that I got to see such a gorgeous movie.congratulations for this production... I could see this movie over and over again! I recommend it to everyone.."
"In the distance future, the human race have discovered a unique planet, Pandora, in which a humanoid alien species, the Na'vi, exists. A highly valuable natural resource can be harvested from Pandora, and great lengths are taken to gain some control of the planet. Jake Sully, a paraplegic war veteran, is offered the chance to take part in a mission to help communication links between humans and the Na'vi by using an 'Avatar' which resemble the Na'vi in appearance. This involves him accidentally getting into the position of getting to know the Na'vi as well as possible in order to eventually persuade them to allow the humans to extract Pandora's valuable natural resourceThere is an obvious colonialist subtext which clings to the narrative of Avatar from the film's opening minutes and this is quite possibly the most rich the narrative ever becomes with little else to provide much depth to the films essence. The story for Avatar is interesting but it is far too cluttered with linear directions on how the film should flow from one scene to the next that by the credits it feels like Avatar has accomplished very little. This is mainly due to the lack of insight provided into the world of Pandora and even the nuances of the Na'vi themselves. Both are explored purely on a foreign viewpoint and it can be argued that this works in conjunction with the world being presented by the human character of Jake, but even when he begins to fuse his being with that of the Na'vi, not much more is presented to the viewer. There is a lot going for the film but it is disappointing that more is not made of it. Another problem lies with the Na'vi themselves. Their language, voices, dress code and cultural mannerism lack any distinct criteria beyond metaphorical elaboration. The Na'vi are, simply put, a mere fantasy retelling of the indigenous tribes of Africa or even American Indians. While this does help the colonialist theme of the film and in making the narrative appear more real, it nevertheless makes the story less unique and only disregards any originality the Na'vi could have as a species. It does not come as a surprise then that the human protagonists are mainly Caucasian and the Na'vi counterparts are African or Native American.Acting is a slightly better department but the actors don't have much to work with as characters fall into defined stereotypes and the odd lines of dialogue lack consistency. Giovanni Ribisi is one of the more spirited actors but he plays a conventional power hungry executive: he becomes representative of the two-dimensional nature of the villains. Caricatures do not stop there but they are less identifiable in the heroes of the story. Worthington provides a more delicate approach to his character showing a clear distinctness in tone between his human and Na'vi selves. This does become questionable at times when even at times of unease his human self appears somewhat lackluster. Zoe Saldana is a pleasure to watch, even though she is a Na'vi, and this is purely because she is more in tune with her character than any other actor. At the end of the day, character development is on the weak side, with one character seemingly deciding to make certain decisions even when little evidence was provided for the character to do so. This also goes as far as character relationships being glazed over, even by the last third of the film where characters seem closer than originally expected.From a technical standpoint the musical score and computer generated imagery work wonders. The music definitely adds to the emotion and feel of the film heightening the more sad and courageous moments while also aiding in scene transition. The computer imagery is staggering in scope encompassing an entire environment. There is the odd scene where textures lose their realistic look but it is in the quality of the animation of characters, creatures and flora where Avatar shines.While sex is implied, there is no nudity beyond the Na'vi wearing little in terms of clothing. Language consists of mild profanities and the odd blasphemous term, while violence ranges from a variety of gunfire and stabbings among others; violence is never gory with minimal blood visible, though some acts can be a little extreme.Avatar is an ambitious film and it deserves to be so with the majestic landscape of Pandora, and her inhabitants, nearly being adequate substitutes for reality. With the well conceived musical score, Avatar has the technical factors nailed but it all falls apart when the film's core narrative is added to the mix. For all the possibilities available, the film forgoes depth for simplicity and convention. If anything, Avatar is an enjoyable film but an enjoyable film with substance that does not equate to its hype."
"Went to see the movie last Saturday at the local I.M.A.X. This is the first chance I have had to write the review, even though the movie and its impact on me has been in the back of my mind since the experience.Experience is the word, this movie is epic, beautiful, engaging, exhilarating and quite simply fantastical.The slight extra cost to view the film (IMAX 3D) was worth every penny and a load more.Visuals are simply stunning from the off. The 3D is extremely impressive from the start and instantly you are emerged in the movie/experience.Yes the story is the same story we have read/seen many times, however the way its presented and told is very well done. Good pacing, great direction and an brilliant score help the 3hrs pass in a flash.So is the movie the groundbreaking event its hyped to be? Well you will have NEVER seen anything quite like this before, so in that respect it is. The effects are almost perfect excluding a couple of frames here and there.James Cameron just knows how to entertain, arguably better than any modern day director/movie maker? Avatar is yet another strong tick in his resume. Personally this could be my favourite Cameron movie in fact.There is nothing I didn't like or enjoy about Avatar. All the cast were fantastic, even though some where only CGI character they still did a great job. Nobody in the production of this movie let the side down.10/10 An epic of the modern day. Quite simply puts a lot of ""event movies"" to shame. Watch this then watch Transformers 2. Night and day.The King of the World is BACK."
"Best special effects ever!Felt like I was there in the jungle.Loved the story as well. This was my first 3D movie and was blown away by how intense it was. Felt like I could reach out the touch the objects on screen. Cool! I plan to see it again several times over the holidays. The experience is like going on a vacation to another planet. I highly recommend this movie for children as well. The message of the movie is very positive. This was the only movie I've been to that the audience applauded at the end. The make-up was excellent, I loved the way the cat-people's ears moved. Totally a not-to-miss film. Bet it wins many awards!"
"James Cameron has thrown down the gauntlet for some time to come with this piece of work. I was speechless at the detail, the beauty, the colours, and of course the 3D imagery. I could have sat for even longer, as I was utterly engrossed. For those who seem hellbent on dismissing this film, you really need to relax, and just enjoy the film for all the reasons I just stated. If you have not seen this yet, don't be a fool. Go see it, watch it in 3D if you can and enjoy an evening of sheer fantasy. Don't bother with food, I sat with a tub of ice cream which had turned to liquid because I was so engrossed. You will not regret watching this!"
"Avatar is an epic. Anyone who watches this will enjoy it. This is one of the few movies that opens your imagination to all sorts of possibilities and potential that humans possess. Not only is this movie incredibly inspirational, but the visuals are of such a high quality that it's as if we have entered a new age of technology. This movie provides for entertainment on all levels. Throughout this movie you will be strapped to your seat with inquisitiveness and amazement. If you don't enjoy the visual effects, you will enjoy the drama. If not the story line. If you don't enjoy either of these, then you might have one major epiphony. Although I enjoyed all of these things, which included a sudden realization of my purpose on earth, and the fire of passion burning inside me that makes me want to achieve this vision even more. Stop reading comments on this movie, and go out and watch it."
"brilliant is the only word, that i use to describe this movie. Knowing the people involved i thought it had to be good, but it really got over the barrier of good, those images of Pandora, the animals, every single thing requires an imagination beyond normal. The visual effects were by far the best that i ever sow, and that is more then enough to make me forget one or other thing that i didn't enjoy to the maximum. overall outstanding work of art, make us wonder what if we could be there.. or better make us want to be a part of it.... 3 more thing to say, the sound effects were simply great, the story was simple, and i think that the movie make us wonder about what are we doing to our planet to.... we should think about it"
